https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001662.htm,Aase syndrome,"Causes Many cases of Aase syndrome occur without a known reason and are not passed down through families (inherited). However, some cases (45%) have been shown to be inherited. These are due to a change in 1 of 20 genes important for making protein correctly (the genes make ribosomal proteins). This condition is similar to Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and the two conditions should considered the same. A missing piece on chromosome 19 is found in some people with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. The anemia in Aase syndrome is caused by poor development of the bone marrow, which is where blood cells are formed.",causes many cases aase syndrome occur without known reason passed families inherited however cases 45 shown inherited due change 1 20 genes important making protein correctly genes make ribosomal proteins condition similar anemia two conditions considered missing piece chromosome 19 found people anemia anemia aase syndrome caused poor development bone marrow blood cells formed,cause many case aase syndrome occur without known reason passed family inherited however case 45 shown inherited due change 1 20 gene important making protein correctly gene make ribosomal protein condition similar anemia two condition considered missing piece chromosome 19 found people anemia anemia aase syndrome caused poor development bone marrow blood cell formed

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007392.htm,Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair - open,"Description The surgery will take place in an operating room. You will be given general anesthesia (you will be asleep and pain-free). Your surgeon opens up your belly and replaces the aortic aneurysm with a man-made, cloth-like material. Here is how it can be done: In one approach, you will lie on your back. The surgeon will make a cut in the middle of your belly, from just below the breastbone to below the belly button. Rarely, the cut goes across the belly. In another approach, you will lie slightly tilted on your right side. The surgeon will make a 5- to 6-inch (13 to 15 centimeters) cut from the left side of your belly, ending a little below your belly button. Your surgeon will replace the aneurysm with a long tube made of man-made (synthetic) cloth. It is sewn in with stitches. In some cases, the ends of this tube (or graft) will be moved through blood vessels in each groin and attached to those in the leg. Once the surgery is done, your legs will be examined to make sure that there is a pulse. Most often a dye test using x-rays is done to confirm that there is good blood flow to the legs. The cut is closed with sutures or staples. Surgery for aortic aneurysm replacement may take 2 to 4 hours.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003120.htm,Abdominal pain,"Considerations Almost everyone has pain in the abdomen at some point. Most of the time, it is not serious. How bad your pain is does not always reflect the seriousness of the condition causing the pain. For example, you might have very bad abdominal pain if you have gas or stomach cramps due to viral gastroenteritis . However, potentially fatal conditions, such as colon cancer or early appendicitis , may only cause mild pain or no pain. Other ways to describe pain in your abdomen include: Generalized pain -- This means that you feel it in more than half of your belly. This type of pain is more typical for a stomach virus, indigestion, or gas. If the pain becomes more severe, it may be caused by a blockage of the intestines. Localized pain -- This is pain found in only one area of your belly. It is more likely to be a sign of a problem in an organ, such as the appendix, gallbladder, or stomach. Cramp-like pain -- This type of pain is not serious most of the time. It is likely to be due to gas and bloating, and is often followed by diarrhea. More worrisome signs include pain that occurs more often, lasts more than 24 hours, or occurs with a fever or rectal bleeding. Colicky pain -- This type of pain comes in waves. It very often starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe.

Here are different kinds of pain: Generalized pain or pain over more than half of the belly. Your child can have this kind of pain when they have a stomach virus, indigestion, gas, or when they become constipated. Cramp-like pain is likely to be due to gas and bloating. It is often followed by diarrhea. It is usually not serious. Colicky pain is pain that comes in waves, usually starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003136.htm,Abdominal rigidity,"Considerations When there is a sore area inside the belly or abdomen, the pain will often get worse when a hand presses against your belly area. Your fear or nervousness about being touched (palpated) may cause your abdominal muscles to stiffen, but there should be no pain. If you have pain when you are touched and you tighten the muscles to guard against more pain, it is more likely caused by a physical condition inside your body.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003137.htm,Abdominal sounds,"Considerations Abdominal sounds (bowel sounds) are made by the movement of the intestines as they push food through. The intestines are hollow, so bowel sounds echo through the abdomen much like the sounds heard from water pipes. Most bowel sounds are normal. They simply mean that the gastrointestinal tract is working. A health care provider can check abdominal sounds by listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope ( auscultation ). Most bowel sounds are harmless. However, there are some cases in which abnormal sounds can indicate a problem. Ileus is a condition in which there is a lack of intestinal activity. Many medical conditions may lead to ileus. This problem can cause gas, fluids, and the contents of the intestines to build up and break open (rupture) the bowel wall. The provider may be unable to hear any bowel sounds when listening to the abdomen. Reduced (hypoactive) bowel sounds include a reduction in the loudness, tone, or regularity of the sounds. They are a sign that intestinal activity has slowed. Hypoactive bowel sounds are normal during sleep. They also occur normally for a short time after the use of certain medicines and after abdominal surgery. Decreased or absent bowel sounds often indicate constipation. Increased ( hyperactive ) bowel sounds can sometimes be heard even without a stethoscope. Hyperactive bowel sounds mean there is an increase in intestinal activity. This may happen with diarrhea or after eating. Abdominal sounds are always evaluated together with symptoms such as: Gas Nausea Presence or absence of bowel movements Vomiting If bowel sounds are hypoactive or hyperactive and there are other abnormal symptoms, you should continue to follow-up with your provider. For example, no bowel sounds after a period of hyperactive bowel sounds can mean there is a rupture of the intestines, or strangulation of the bowel and death ( necrosis ) of the bowel tissue. Very high-pitched bowel sounds may be a sign of early bowel obstruction.",considerations abdominal sounds bowel sounds made movement intestines push food intestines hollow bowel sounds echo abdomen much like sounds heard water pipes bowel sounds normal simply mean gastrointestinal tract working health care provider check abdominal sounds listening abdomen stethoscope auscultation bowel sounds harmless however cases abnormal sounds indicate problem ileus condition lack intestinal activity many medical conditions may lead ileus problem cause gas fluids contents intestines build break open rupture bowel wall provider may unable hear bowel sounds listening abdomen reduced hypoactive bowel sounds include reduction loudness tone regularity sounds sign intestinal activity slowed hypoactive bowel sounds normal sleep also occur normally short time use certain medicines abdominal surgery decreased absent bowel sounds often indicate constipation increased hyperactive bowel sounds sometimes heard even without stethoscope hyperactive bowel sounds mean increase intestinal activity may happen diarrhea eating abdominal sounds always evaluated together symptoms gas nausea presence absence bowel movements vomiting bowel sounds hypoactive hyperactive abnormal symptoms continue provider example bowel sounds period hyperactive bowel sounds mean rupture intestines strangulation bowel death necrosis bowel tissue bowel sounds may sign early bowel obstruction,consideration abdominal sound bowel sound made movement intestine push food intestine hollow bowel sound echo abdomen much like sound heard water pipe bowel sound normal simply mean gastrointestinal tract working health care provider check abdominal sound listening abdomen stethoscope auscultation bowel sound harmless however case abnormal sound indicate problem ileus condition lack intestinal activity many medical condition may lead ileus problem cause gas fluid content intestine build break open rupture bowel wall provider may unable hear bowel sound listening abdomen reduced hypoactive bowel sound include reduction loudness tone regularity sound sign intestinal activity slowed hypoactive bowel sound normal sleep also occur normally short time use certain medicine abdominal surgery decreased absent bowel sound often indicate constipation increased hyperactive bowel sound sometimes heard even without stethoscope hyperactive bowel sound mean increase intestinal activity may happen diarrhea eating abdominal sound always evaluated together symptom gas nausea presence absence bowel movement vomiting bowel sound hypoactive hyperactive abnormal symptom continue provider example bowel sound period hyperactive bowel sound mean rupture intestine strangulation bowel death necrosis bowel tissue bowel sound may sign early bowel obstruction

The puncture site will be cleaned and shaved, if necessary. You then receive a local numbing medicine. The tap needle is inserted 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) into the abdomen. Sometimes, a small cut is made to help insert the needle. The fluid is pulled out into a syringe. The needle is removed. A dressing is placed on the puncture site. If a cut was made, one or two stitches may be used to close it. Sometimes, ultrasound is used to guide the needle. An ultrasound uses sound waves to make the image and not x-rays. It does not hurt. There are 2 kinds of abdominal taps: Diagnostic tap -- A small amount of fluid is taken and sent to the laboratory for testing.

DO NOT perform first aid if the person is coughing forcefully and is able to speak. A strong cough can often dislodge the object. If the person is choking, perform abdominal thrusts as follows: If the person is sitting or standing, position yourself behind the person and reach your arms around their waist. For a child, you may have to kneel. Place your fist, thumb side in, just above the person's navel (belly button). Grasp the fist tightly with your other hand. Make quick, upward and inward thrusts with your fist. If the person is lying on their back, straddle the person facing the head. Push your grasped fist upward and inward in a movement similar to the one above. You may need to repeat the procedure several times before the object is dislodged.

Unlike with x-rays or CT scans , this test does not expose you to ionizing radiation. You will be lying down for the procedure. A clear, water-based conducting gel is applied to the skin over the abdomen. This helps with the transmission of the sound waves. A handheld probe called a transducer is then moved over the abdomen. You may need to change position so that the health care provider can look at different areas. You may also need to hold your breath for short periods during the exam.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001966.htm,Babies and heat rashes,"Information To avoid heat rash, keep your baby cool and dry during warm weather. Some helpful suggestions: During the hot season, dress your baby in lightweight, soft, cotton clothing. Cotton is very absorbent and keeps moisture away from your baby's skin. If air conditioning is not available, a fan may help cool your infant. Place the fan far enough away so that there is only a gentle breeze drifting over your infant. Avoid the use of powders, creams, and ointments. Baby powders do not improve or prevent heat rash.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001967.htm,Babies and shots,"Information Parents often wonder how to make shots less painful for their babies. Nearly all immunizations (also called vaccinations) need to be given into the muscle or under the skin using a needle and syringe. Reducing your child's anxiety level may be the best way to help limit the pain. Here are some tips. BEFORE THE SHOT Tell older children that the shot is needed to keep them safe and healthy. Knowing what to expect ahead of time may reassure the child. Explain to the child that it is OK to cry. But suggest that the child try to be brave. Explain that you do not like shots either, but you try to be brave, too. Praise the child after the shot is over, whether or not they cry. Plan something fun to do afterward. A trip to the park or other entertainment after the shot can make the next one less scary. Some health care providers use a pain-relieving spray or cream before giving the shot. WHEN THE SHOT IS BEING GIVEN Put pressure on the area before the shot is given. Stay calm and do not let the child see if you are upset or anxious. The child will notice if you cringe before the shot. Talk calmly and use soothing words. Follow the provider's instructions about how to hold your child to steady the leg or arm that will get the shot. Distract the child by blowing bubbles or playing with a toy. Or point out a picture on the wall, count or say the ABCs, or tell the child something funny. WHAT TO EXPECT AT HOME After the shot is given, a cool, damp cloth may be placed on the vaccination site to help reduce soreness. Frequently moving or using the arm or leg that received the shot may also help reduce the soreness.

Did you have an injury or accident? What were you doing just before the pain began? For example, were you lifting or bending? Sitting at your computer? Driving a long distance? If you have had back pain before, is this pain similar or different? In what way is it different? Do you know what caused your back pain in the past? How long does each episode of back pain usually last? Do you feel the pain anywhere else, such as in your hip, thigh, leg or feet? Do you have any numbness or tingling? Any weakness or loss of function in your leg or elsewhere? What makes the pain worse? Lifting, twisting, standing, or sitting for long periods? What makes you feel better? Does bearing down or straining make your pain worse? You will also be asked if you have other symptoms, which may point to a more serious cause. Tell your provider if you have had weight loss, fever, a change in urination or bowel habits, or a history of cancer . Your provider will perform a physical exam to try to find the exact location of your pain, and determine how it affects your movement. Your back will be pressed on at different spots to find where it hurts. You will also be asked to: Sit, stand, and walk Walk on your toes and then your heels Bend forward, backward, and sideways Lift your legs straight up while lying down Move your back in certain positions If the pain is worse and goes down your leg when you lift your legs straight up while lying down, you may have sciatica, especially if you also feel numbness or tingling going down the same leg.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003817.htm,Barium enema,"How the Test is Performed This test may be done in a health care provider's office or hospital radiology department. It is done after your colon is completely empty and clean. Your provider will give you instructions for cleansing your colon. During the test: You lie flat on your back on the x-ray table. An x-ray is taken. You then lie on your side. The provider gently inserts a well-lubricated tube (enema tube) into your rectum. The tube is connected to a bag that holds a liquid containing barium sulfate. This is a contrast material that highlights specific areas in the colon, creating a clear image. The barium flows into your colon. X-rays are taken. A small balloon at the tip of the enema tube may be inflated to help keep the barium inside your colon. The provider monitors the flow of the barium on an x-ray screen. Sometimes a small amount of air is delivered into the colon to expand it. This allows for even clearer images. This test is called a double contrast barium enema. You are asked to move into different positions. The table will move up and down to get different views. At certain times when the x-ray pictures are taken, you are told to hold your breath and be still for a few seconds so the images will not be blurry. The enema tube is removed after the x-rays are taken. You are then given a bedpan or helped to the toilet, so you can empty your bowels and remove as much of the barium as possible. Afterward, 1 or 2 more x-rays may be taken.",test performed test may done health care provider office hospital radiology department done colon completely empty clean provider give instructions cleansing colon test lie flat back table taken lie side provider gently inserts tube enema tube rectum tube connected bag holds liquid containing barium sulfate contrast material highlights specific areas colon creating clear image barium flows colon taken small balloon tip enema tube may inflated help keep barium inside colon provider monitors flow barium screen sometimes small amount air delivered colon expand allows even clearer images test called double contrast barium enema asked move different positions table move get different views certain times pictures taken told hold breath still seconds images blurry enema tube removed taken given bedpan helped toilet empty bowels remove much barium possible afterward 1 2 may taken,test performed test may done health care provider office hospital radiology department done colon completely empty clean provider give instruction cleansing colon test lie flat back table taken lie side provider gently insert tube enema tube rectum tube connected bag hold liquid containing barium sulfate contrast material highlight specific area colon creating clear image barium flow colon taken small balloon tip enema tube may inflated help keep barium inside colon provider monitor flow barium screen sometimes small amount air delivered colon expand allows even clearer image test called double contrast barium enema asked move different position table move get different view certain time picture taken told hold breath still second image blurry enema tube removed taken given bedpan helped toilet empty bowel remove much barium possible afterward 1 2 may taken

This causes a rise in the level of the hormone aldosterone, and makes the kidneys remove too much potassium from the body. This is known as potassium wasting. The condition also results in an abnormal acid balance in the blood called hypokalemic alkalosis, which causes too much calcium in the urine.",causes five gene defects known associated bartter syndrome condition present birth congenital condition caused defect kidneys ability reabsorb sodium people affected bartter syndrome lose much sodium urine causes rise level hormone aldosterone makes kidneys remove much potassium body known potassium wasting condition also results abnormal acid balance blood called hypokalemic alkalosis causes much calcium urine,cause five gene defect known associated bartter syndrome condition present birth congenital condition caused defect kidney ability reabsorb sodium people affected bartter syndrome lose much sodium urine cause rise level hormone aldosterone make kidney remove much potassium body known potassium wasting condition also result abnormal acid balance blood called hypokalemic alkalosis cause much calcium urine

The buildup of this chemical forms crystals in the cartilage of joints. This leads to attacks of joint swelling and pain most often in the knees, wrists, ankles, and shoulders. Other joints can be affected as well. In contrast to gout, the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the big toe is not affected. Among older adults, CPPD is a common cause of sudden (acute) arthritis in one joint. The attack may be caused by: Injury to the joint Medical stress CPPD arthritis mainly affects the elderly because joint degeneration and osteoarthritis increases with age. Such joint damage increases the tendency of CPPD deposition.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007453.htm,Deep brain stimulation,"Description The DBS system consist of four parts: One or more, insulated wires called leads, or electrodes, that are placed into the brain Anchors to fix the leads to the skull The neurostimulator, which puts out the electric current. The neurostimulator is like a heart pacemaker. It is usually placed under the skin below the collarbone, but may be placed under the skin in another area of the body In some people another thin, insulated wire called an extension is added to connect the lead to the neurostimulator Surgery is done to place each part of the neurostimulator system. In adults, the whole system can be placed in 1 or 2 stages (two separate surgeries). Stage 1 is usually done under local anesthesia, meaning you are awake, but pain-free. (In children, general anesthesia is given.) A bit of hair on your head is likely shaved. Your head may be placed in a special frame using small screws to keep it still during the procedure. Numbing medicine is applied where the screws contact the scalp. Sometimes, the procedure is done in the MRI machine and a frame is on top of your head rather than around your head. Numbing medicine is applied to your scalp at the site where the surgeon will open the skin, then drill a small opening (burr hole) in the skull and place the lead into a specific area of the brain. If both sides of your brain are being treated, the surgeon makes an opening on each side of the skull, and two leads are inserted. Electrical impulses may need to be sent through the lead to make sure it is connected to the area of the brain responsible for your symptoms. You may be asked questions, to read cards, or describe images. You may also be asked to move your legs or arms. These are to make sure the electrodes are in the right positions and the expected effect is achieved. Stage 2 is done under general anesthesia, meaning you are asleep and pain-free. The timing of this stage of surgery depends on where in the brain the stimulator will be placed. The surgeon makes a small opening (incision), usually just below the collarbone and implants the neurostimulator under the skin. (Sometimes it is placed under the skin in the lower chest or belly area.) The extension wire is tunneled under the skin of the head, neck, and shoulder and connected to the neurostimulator. The incision is closed. The device and wires are under the skin and can appear as a slight bump. Once connected, electric pulses travel from the neurostimulator, along the extension wire, to the lead, and into the brain. These tiny pulses interfere with and block the electrical signals that cause symptoms of certain diseases.",description dbs system consist four parts one insulated wires called leads electrodes placed brain anchors fix leads skull neurostimulator puts electric current neurostimulator like heart pacemaker usually placed skin collarbone may placed skin another area body people another thin insulated wire called extension added connect lead neurostimulator surgery done place part neurostimulator system adults whole system placed 1 2 stages two separate surgeries stage 1 usually done local anesthesia meaning awake children general anesthesia given bit hair head likely shaved head may placed special frame using small screws keep still procedure numbing medicine applied screws contact scalp sometimes procedure done mri machine frame top head rather around head numbing medicine applied scalp site surgeon open skin drill small opening burr hole skull place lead specific area brain sides brain treated surgeon makes opening side skull two leads inserted electrical impulses may need sent lead make sure connected area brain responsible symptoms may asked questions read cards describe images may also asked move legs arms make sure electrodes right positions expected effect achieved stage 2 done general anesthesia meaning asleep timing stage surgery depends brain stimulator placed surgeon makes small opening incision usually collarbone implants neurostimulator skin sometimes placed skin lower chest belly area extension wire tunneled skin head neck shoulder connected neurostimulator incision closed device wires skin appear slight bump connected electric pulses travel neurostimulator along extension wire lead brain tiny pulses interfere block electrical signals cause symptoms certain diseases,description db system consist four part one insulated wire called lead electrode placed brain anchor fix lead skull neurostimulator put electric current neurostimulator like heart pacemaker usually placed skin collarbone may placed skin another area body people another thin insulated wire called extension added connect lead neurostimulator surgery done place part neurostimulator system adult whole system placed 1 2 stage two separate surgery stage 1 usually done local anesthesia meaning awake child general anesthesia given bit hair head likely shaved head may placed special frame using small screw keep still procedure numbing medicine applied screw contact scalp sometimes procedure done mri machine frame top head rather around head numbing medicine applied scalp site surgeon open skin drill small opening burr hole skull place lead specific area brain side brain treated surgeon make opening side skull two lead inserted electrical impulse may need sent lead make sure connected area brain responsible symptom may asked question read card describe image may also asked move leg arm make sure electrode right position expected effect achieved stage 2 done general anesthesia meaning asleep timing stage surgery depends brain stimulator placed surgeon make small opening incision usually collarbone implant neurostimulator skin sometimes placed skin lower chest belly area extension wire tunneled skin head neck shoulder connected neurostimulator incision closed device wire skin appear slight bump connected electric pulse travel neurostimulator along extension wire lead brain tiny pulse interfere block electrical signal cause symptom certain disease

The risk of dementia increases as a person gets older. Most types of dementia are nonreversible and degenerative. Nonreversible means the changes in the brain that are causing the dementia cannot be stopped or turned back. Alzheimer disease is the most common type of dementia. Another common type of dementia is vascular dementia . It is caused by poor blood flow to the brain, such as with stroke. Lewy body disease is another cause of dementia in older adults. People with this condition have abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain. Any condition that results in injury to the brain can cause dementia. The following medical conditions can also lead to dementia: Huntington disease Brain injury Frontotemporal degeneration (Pick disease) Multiple sclerosis Infections such as HIV/AIDS , syphilis , and Lyme disease Parkinson disease Progressive supranuclear palsy Excess alcohol use Brain trauma Some causes of dementia, such as those due to abnormal chemical processes in the body , may be stopped or reversed if they are found soon enough, including: Brain injury Brain tumors Long-term (chronic) alcohol abuse Changes in blood sugar, sodium, and calcium levels Low vitamin B12 level Normal pressure hydrocephalus Use of certain medicines, including cimetidine and some cholesterol medicines Some brain infections",causes dementia usually occurs older age types rare people age risk dementia increases person gets older types dementia nonreversible degenerative nonreversible means changes brain causing dementia stopped turned back alzheimer disease common type dementia another common type dementia vascular dementia caused poor blood flow brain stroke lewy body disease another cause dementia older adults people condition abnormal protein structures certain areas brain condition results injury brain cause dementia following medical conditions also lead dementia huntington disease brain injury frontotemporal degeneration pick disease multiple sclerosis infections syphilis lyme disease parkinson disease progressive supranuclear palsy excess alcohol use brain trauma causes dementia due abnormal chemical processes body may stopped reversed found soon enough including brain injury brain tumors chronic alcohol abuse changes blood sugar sodium calcium levels low vitamin b12 level normal pressure hydrocephalus use certain medicines including cimetidine cholesterol medicines brain infections,cause dementia usually occurs older age type rare people age risk dementia increase person get older type dementia nonreversible degenerative nonreversible mean change brain causing dementia stopped turned back alzheimer disease common type dementia another common type dementia vascular dementia caused poor blood flow brain stroke lewy body disease another cause dementia older adult people condition abnormal protein structure certain area brain condition result injury brain cause dementia following medical condition also lead dementia huntington disease brain injury frontotemporal degeneration pick disease multiple sclerosis infection syphilis lyme disease parkinson disease progressive supranuclear palsy excess alcohol use brain trauma cause dementia due abnormal chemical process body may stopped reversed found soon enough including brain injury brain tumor chronic alcohol abuse change blood sugar sodium calcium level low vitamin b12 level normal pressure hydrocephalus use certain medicine including cimetidine cholesterol medicine brain infection

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002077.htm,Ear - blocked at high altitudes,"Information The eustachian tube is a connection between the middle ear (the space behind the eardrum) and the back of the nose and upper throat. This structure connects the middle ear space to the outside world. Swallowing or yawning opens the eustachian tube and allows air to flow into or out of the middle ear. This helps equalize pressure on either side of the eardrum. Swallowing or yawning can unclog blocked ears when you are going up or coming down from high altitudes. Chewing gum the entire time you are changing altitudes helps by causing you to swallow often. This may prevent your ears from getting blocked. People who always have blocked ears when flying may want to take a decongestant about an hour before the flight leaves. If your ears are blocked, you can try breathing in, then gently breathing out while holding your nostrils and mouth closed. Use care when doing this. If you breathe out too forcefully, you can cause ear infections by forcing bacteria into your ear canals. You can also create a hole (perforation) in your eardrum if you blow too hard.",information eustachian tube connection middle ear space behind eardrum back nose upper throat structure connects middle ear space outside world swallowing yawning opens eustachian tube allows air flow middle ear helps equalize pressure either side eardrum swallowing yawning unclog blocked ears going coming high altitudes chewing gum entire time changing altitudes helps causing swallow often may prevent ears getting blocked people always blocked ears flying may want take decongestant hour flight leaves ears blocked try breathing gently breathing holding nostrils mouth closed use care breathe forcefully cause ear infections forcing bacteria ear canals also create hole perforation eardrum blow hard,information eustachian tube connection middle ear space behind eardrum back nose upper throat structure connects middle ear space outside world swallowing yawning open eustachian tube allows air flow middle ear help equalize pressure either side eardrum swallowing yawning unclog blocked ear going coming high altitude chewing gum entire time changing altitude help causing swallow often may prevent ear getting blocked people always blocked ear flying may want take decongestant hour flight leaf ear blocked try breathing gently breathing holding nostril mouth closed use care breathe forcefully cause ear infection forcing bacteria ear canal also create hole perforation eardrum blow hard

The eustachian tube is a connection between the middle ear and the back of the nose and upper throat. Swallowing or yawning opens the eustachian tube and allows air to flow into or out of the middle ear. This helps equalize pressure on either side of the ear drum. If the eustachian tube is blocked, the air pressure in the middle ear is different than the pressure on the outside of the eardrum. This can cause barotrauma. Many people have barotrauma at some time. The problem often occurs with altitude changes, such as flying, scuba diving, or driving in the mountains.

Older children and adults may sit with the head tilted toward the shoulder opposite the ear being examined. The provider will gently pull up, back, or forward on the ear to straighten the ear canal. Then, the tip of the otoscope will be placed gently into your ear. A light beam shines through the otoscope into the ear canal. The provider will carefully move the scope in different directions to see the inside of the ear and eardrum. Sometimes, this view may be blocked by earwax. An ear specialist may use a binocular microscope to get a magnified look at the ear. The otoscope may have a plastic bulb on it, which delivers a tiny puff of air into the outer ear canal when pressed. This is done to see how the eardrum moves.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000638.htm,Ear infection - acute,"Causes The eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. Normally, this tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If this tube gets blocked, fluid can build up. This can lead to infection. Ear infections are common in infants and children because their eustachian tubes are easily clogged. Ear infections can also occur in adults, although they are less common than in children. Anything that causes the eustachian tubes to become swollen or blocked leads to more fluid buildup in the middle ear behind the eardrum. Some causes are: Allergies Colds and sinus infections Excess mucus and saliva produced during teething Infected or overgrown adenoids (lymph tissue in the upper part of the throat) Tobacco smoke Ear infections are also more likely in children who spend a lot of time drinking from a sippy cup or bottle while lying on their back. Milk may enter the eustachian tube, which may increase the risk of an ear infection. Getting water in the ears will not cause an acute ear infection unless the eardrum has a hole in it. Other risk factors for acute ear infections include: Attending day care (especially centers with more than 6 children) Changes in altitude or climate Cold climate Exposure to smoke Family history of ear infections Not being breastfed Pacifier use Recent ear infection Recent illness of any type (because illness lowers the body's resistance to infection) Birth defect, leading to deficiency in eustachian tube function",causes eustachian tube runs middle ear back throat normally tube drains fluid made middle ear tube gets blocked fluid build lead infection ear infections common infants children eustachian tubes easily clogged ear infections also occur adults although less common children anything causes eustachian tubes become swollen blocked leads fluid buildup middle ear behind eardrum causes allergies colds sinus infections excess mucus saliva produced teething infected overgrown adenoids lymph tissue upper part throat tobacco smoke ear infections also likely children spend lot time drinking sippy cup bottle lying back milk may enter eustachian tube may increase risk ear infection getting water ears cause acute ear infection unless eardrum hole risk factors acute ear infections include attending day care especially centers 6 children changes altitude climate cold climate exposure smoke family history ear infections breastfed pacifier use recent ear infection recent illness type illness lowers body resistance infection birth defect leading deficiency eustachian tube function,cause eustachian tube run middle ear back throat normally tube drain fluid made middle ear tube get blocked fluid build lead infection ear infection common infant child eustachian tube easily clogged ear infection also occur adult although less common child anything cause eustachian tube become swollen blocked lead fluid buildup middle ear behind eardrum cause allergy cold sinus infection excess mucus saliva produced teething infected overgrown adenoid lymph tissue upper part throat tobacco smoke ear infection also likely child spend lot time drinking sippy cup bottle lying back milk may enter eustachian tube may increase risk ear infection getting water ear cause acute ear infection unless eardrum hole risk factor acute ear infection include attending day care especially center 6 child change altitude climate cold climate exposure smoke family history ear infection breastfed pacifier use recent ear infection recent illness type illness lower body resistance infection birth defect leading deficiency eustachian tube function

HOW EBOLA CAN SPREAD Ebola does not spread as easily as more common illnesses such as colds, the flu, or measles. There is no evidence that the virus that causes Ebola is spread through the air or water. A person who has Ebola can't spread the disease until symptoms appear. Ebola can only spread between humans by direct contact with infected body fluids including but not limited to urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and semen. The virus can enter the body through a break in the skin or through mucous membranes, including the eyes, nose, and mouth. Ebola can also spread by contact with any surfaces, objects, or materials that have been in contact with body fluids from a sick person, such as: Bedclothes and bedding Clothing Bandages Needles and syringes Medical equipment In Africa, Ebola may also be spread by: Handling infected wild animals hunted for food (bushmeat) Contact with blood or body fluids of infected animals Contact with infected bats Ebola does not spread through: Air Water Food Insects (mosquitoes) Health care workers and people caring for sick relatives are at high risk for developing Ebola because they are more likely to come in to direct contact with body fluids.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007321.htm,Ebstein anomaly,"Causes The tricuspid valve is normally made of three parts, called leaflets or flaps. The leaflets open to allow blood to move from the right atrium (top chamber) to the right ventricle (bottom chamber) while the heart relaxes. They close to prevent blood from moving from the right ventricle to the right atrium while the heart pumps. In people with Ebstein anomaly, the leaflets are placed deeper into the right ventricle instead of the normal position. The leaflets are often larger than normal. The defect most often causes the valve to work poorly, and blood may go the wrong way. Instead of flowing out to the lungs, the blood flows back into the right atrium. The backup of blood flow can lead to heart enlargement and fluid buildup in the body. There may also be narrowing of the valve that leads to the lungs (pulmonary valve). In many cases, people also have a hole in the wall separating the heart's two upper chambers ( atrial septal defect ) and blood flow across this hole may cause oxygen-poor blood to go to the body.

A cyst is a closed pocket or pouch. The cysts keep growing, which leads to symptoms. E granulosus is an infection caused by tapeworms found in dogs and livestock such as sheep, pigs, goats, and cattle. These tapeworms are around 2 to 7 mm long. The infection is called cystic echinococcosis (CE). It leads to growth of cysts mainly in the lungs and liver. Cysts can also be found in the heart, bones, and brain. E multilocularis is the infection caused by tapeworms found in dogs, cats, rodents, and foxes. These tapeworms are around 1 to 4 mm long. The infection is called alveolar echinococcosis (AE). It is a life-threatening condition because tumor-like growths form in the liver. Other organs, such as the lungs and brain can be affected. Children or young adults are more prone to get the infection. Echinococcosis is common in: Africa Central Asia Southern South America The Mediterranean The Middle East In rare cases, the infection is seen in the United States.

If the provider cannot see the gallbladder after certain amount of time, you may be given a small amount of morphine. This can help the radioactive material get into the gallbladder. The morphine may cause you to feel tired after the exam. In some cases, you may be given a medicine during this test to see how well your gallbladder squeezes (contracts).

Depending on what part of the stomach was removed, the intestine may need to be reconnected to the remaining stomach (partial gastrectomy) or to the esophagus (total gastrectomy). Some surgeons can also do this surgery using a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a tiny camera that is inserted into your belly through a small cut. Video from the camera will appear on a monitor in the operating room. The surgeon views the monitor to do the surgery. When done this way, the surgery, which is called laparoscopy, is done with a few small surgical cuts.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007199.htm,Gastric bypass surgery,"Description You will have general anesthesia before this surgery. You will be asleep and pain-free. There are 2 steps during gastric bypass surgery: The first step makes your stomach smaller. Your surgeon uses staples to divide your stomach into a small upper section and a larger bottom section. The top section of your stomach (called the pouch) is where the food you eat will go. The pouch is about the size of a walnut. It holds only about 1 ounce (oz) or 28 grams (g) of food. Because of this you will eat less and lose weight. The second step is the bypass. Your surgeon connects a part of your small intestine (the jejunum) to a small hole in your pouch. The food you eat will now travel from the pouch into this new opening and into your small intestine below where it would normally go, thus bypassing part of your small intestine. As a result, your body will absorb fewer calories. Gastric bypass can be done in two ways. With open surgery, your surgeon makes a large surgical cut to open your belly. The bypass is done by working on your stomach, small intestine, and other organs. Another way to do this surgery is to use a tiny camera, called a laparoscope. This camera is placed in your belly. The surgery is called laparoscopy. The scope allows the surgeon to see inside your belly. In laparoscopic surgery: The surgeon makes 4 to 6 small cuts in your belly. The scope and instruments needed to perform the surgery are inserted through these cuts. The camera is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view inside your belly while doing the operation. Advantages of laparoscopy over open surgery include: Shorter hospital stay and quicker recovery Less pain Smaller scars and a lower risk for getting a hernia or infection This surgery takes about 2 to 4 hours.",description general anesthesia surgery asleep 2 steps gastric bypass surgery first step makes stomach smaller surgeon uses staples divide stomach small upper section larger bottom section top section stomach called pouch food eat go pouch size walnut holds 1 ounce oz 28 grams g food eat less lose weight second step bypass surgeon connects part small intestine jejunum small hole pouch food eat travel pouch new opening small intestine would normally go thus bypassing part small intestine result body absorb fewer calories gastric bypass done two ways open surgery surgeon makes large surgical cut open belly bypass done working stomach small intestine organs another way surgery use tiny camera called laparoscope camera placed belly surgery called laparoscopy scope allows surgeon see inside belly laparoscopic surgery surgeon makes 4 6 small cuts belly scope instruments needed perform surgery inserted cuts camera connected video monitor operating room allows surgeon view inside belly operation advantages laparoscopy open surgery include shorter hospital stay quicker recovery less pain smaller scars lower risk getting hernia infection surgery takes 2 4 hours,description general anesthesia surgery asleep 2 step gastric bypass surgery first step make stomach smaller surgeon us staple divide stomach small upper section larger bottom section top section stomach called pouch food eat go pouch size walnut hold 1 ounce oz 28 gram g food eat less lose weight second step bypass surgeon connects part small intestine jejunum small hole pouch food eat travel pouch new opening small intestine would normally go thus bypassing part small intestine result body absorb fewer calorie gastric bypass done two way open surgery surgeon make large surgical cut open belly bypass done working stomach small intestine organ another way surgery use tiny camera called laparoscope camera placed belly surgery called laparoscopy scope allows surgeon see inside belly laparoscopic surgery surgeon make 4 6 small cut belly scope instrument needed perform surgery inserted cut camera connected video monitor operating room allows surgeon view inside belly operation advantage laparoscopy open surgery include shorter hospital stay quicker recovery less pain smaller scar lower risk getting hernia infection surgery take 2 4 hour

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000265.htm,Gastroesophageal reflux disease,"Causes When you eat, food passes from the throat to the stomach through the esophagus. A ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus prevents swallowed food from moving back up. These muscle fibers are called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). When this ring of muscle does not close all the way, stomach contents can leak back into the esophagus. This is called reflux or gastroesophageal reflux. Reflux may cause symptoms. Harsh stomach acids can also damage the lining of the esophagus. The risk factors for reflux include: Use of alcohol (possibly) Hiatal hernia (a condition in which part of the stomach moves above the diaphragm, which is the muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities) Obesity Pregnancy Scleroderma Smoking or tobacco use Lying down within 3 hours after eating Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux can be caused by or made worse by pregnancy.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007597.htm,Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine - what you need to know,"Information Why get vaccinated? Hib vaccine can prevent Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease . Haemophilus influenzae type b can cause many different kinds of infections. These infections usually affect children under 5 years of age but can also affect adults with certain medical conditions. Hib bacteria can cause mild illness, such as ear infections or bronchitis, or they can cause severe illness, such as infections of the blood. Severe Hib infection, also called ""invasive Hib disease,"" requires treatment in a hospital and can sometimes result in death. Before Hib vaccine, Hib disease was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis among children under 5 years old in the United States. Meningitis is an infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord. It can lead to brain damage and deafness. Hib infection can also cause: Pneumonia Severe swelling in the throat, making it hard to breathe Infections of the blood, joints, bones, and covering of the heart Death Hib vaccine Hib vaccine is usually given in 3 or 4 doses (depending on brand). Infants will usually get their first dose of Hib vaccine at 2 months of age and will usually complete the series at 12 - 15 months of age. Children between 12 months and 5 years of age who have not previously been completely vaccinated against Hib may need 1 or more doses of Hib vaccine. Children over 5 years old and adults usually do not receive Hib vaccine, but it might be recommended for older children or adults whose spleen is damaged or has been removed, including people with sickle cell disease, before surgery to remove the spleen, or following a bone marrow transplant. Hib vaccine may also be recommended for people 5 through 18 years old with HIV. Hib vaccine may be given as a stand-alone vaccine, or as part of a combination vaccine (a type of vaccine that combines more than one vaccine together into one shot). Hib vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Talk with your health care provider Tell your vaccination provider if the person getting the vaccine: Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of Hib vaccine, or has any severe, life-threatening allergies In some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone Hib vaccination until a future visit. People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting Hib vaccine. Your health care provider can give you more information. Risks of a vaccine reaction Redness, warmth, and swelling where the shot is given and fever can happen after Hib vaccination. People sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears. As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death. What if there is a serious problem? An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person to the nearest hospital. For other signs that concern you, call your health care provider. Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov or call 1-800-822-7967 . VAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff members do not give medical advice. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Claims regarding alleged injury or death due to vaccination have a time limit for filing, which may be as short as two years. Visit the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html or call 1-800-338-2382 to learn about the program and about filing a claim. How can I learn more? Ask your health care provider.

Most hair transplants are done in a doctor's office. The procedure is performed as follows: You receive local anesthesia to numb the scalp. You may also receive medicine to relax you. Your scalp is thoroughly cleaned. A strip of your hairy scalp is removed using a scalpel (surgical knife) and set aside. This area of your scalp is called the donor area. The scalp is closed using tiny stitches. Small groups of hairs, or individual hairs, are carefully separated out from the removed scalp, often done under magnification or microscope. In some cases, smaller areas of the scalp and groups of hairs are removed with other equipment or robotic assistance. The bald areas that will receive these healthy hairs are cleaned. These areas of your scalp are called the recipient areas. Tiny cuts are made in the bald area. Healthy hairs are carefully placed in the cuts.

When your ileostomy is temporary, it most often means all of your large intestine was removed. However, you still have at least part of your rectum. If you have surgery on part of your large intestine, your health care provider may want the remainder of your intestine to rest for a while. You will use the ileostomy while you recover from this surgery. When you do not need it anymore, you will have another surgery. This surgery will be done to reattach the ends of the small intestine. You will no longer need the ileostomy after this. You will need to use it long-term if all of your large intestine and rectum have been removed. To create the ileostomy, the surgeon makes a small surgical cut in the wall of your belly. Part of your small intestine that is farthest from your stomach is brought up and used to make an opening. This is called a stoma. When you look at your stoma, you are actually looking at the lining of your intestine. It looks a lot like the inside of your cheek.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007451.htm,Imaging and radiology,"Information DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY Diagnostic radiology helps health care providers see structures inside your body. Doctors that specialize in the interpretation of these images are called diagnostic radiologists. Using the diagnostic images, the radiologist or other providers can often: Diagnose the cause of your symptoms Monitor how well your body is responding to a treatment you are receiving for your disease or condition Screen for different illnesses, such as breast cancer, colon cancer, or heart disease The most common types of diagnostic radiology exams include: Computed tomography (CT), also known as a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan, including CT angiography Fluoroscopy, including upper GI and barium enema Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) Mammography Nuclear medicine, which includes such tests as a bone scan , thyroid scan , and thallium cardiac stress test Plain x-rays , which includes chest x-ray Positron emission tomography , also called PET imaging, PET scan, or PET-CT when it is combined with CT Ultrasound INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY Interventional radiologists are doctors that use imaging such as CT, ultrasound, MRI, and fluoroscopy to help guide procedures. The imaging is helpful to the doctor when inserting catheters, wires, and other small instruments and tools into your body. This typically allows for smaller incisions (cuts). Providers can use this technology to detect or treat conditions in almost any part of the body instead of using larger incisions and directly looking inside of your body through a scope (camera) or with open surgery. Interventional radiologists often are involved in treating cancers or tumors, blockages in the arteries and veins, fibroids in the uterus, back pain, liver problems, and kidney problems. The interventional radiologist will make no incision or only a very small one. You rarely need to stay in the hospital after the procedure. Most people need only moderate sedation (medicines to help you relax). Examples of interventional radiology procedures include: Angiography or angioplasty and stent placement Embolization to control bleeding Cancer treatments including tumor embolization using chemoembolization or Y-90 radioembolization Tumor ablation with radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, or microwave ablation Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty Needle biopsies of different organs, such as the lungs and thyroid gland Breast biopsy, guided either by stereotactic or ultrasound techniques Uterine artery embolization Feeding tube placement Venous access catheter placement, such as ports and PICCs",information diagnostic radiology diagnostic radiology helps health care providers see structures inside body doctors specialize interpretation images called diagnostic radiologists using diagnostic images radiologist providers often diagnose cause symptoms monitor well body responding treatment receiving disease condition screen different illnesses breast cancer colon cancer heart disease common types diagnostic radiology exams include computed tomography ct also known computerized axial tomography cat scan including ct angiography fluoroscopy including upper gi barium enema magnetic resonance imaging mri magnetic resonance angiography mra mammography nuclear medicine includes tests bone scan thyroid scan thallium cardiac stress test plain includes chest positron emission tomography also called pet imaging pet scan combined ct ultrasound interventional radiology interventional radiologists doctors use imaging ct ultrasound mri fluoroscopy help guide procedures imaging helpful doctor inserting catheters wires small instruments tools body typically allows smaller incisions cuts providers use technology detect treat conditions almost part body instead using larger incisions directly looking inside body scope camera open surgery interventional radiologists often involved treating cancers tumors blockages arteries veins fibroids uterus back pain liver problems kidney problems interventional radiologist make incision small one rarely need stay hospital procedure people need moderate sedation medicines help relax examples interventional radiology procedures include angiography angioplasty stent placement embolization control bleeding cancer treatments including tumor embolization using chemoembolization radioembolization tumor ablation radiofrequency ablation cryoablation microwave ablation vertebroplasty kyphoplasty needle biopsies different organs lungs thyroid gland breast biopsy guided either stereotactic ultrasound techniques uterine artery embolization feeding tube placement venous access catheter placement ports piccs,information diagnostic radiology diagnostic radiology help health care provider see structure inside body doctor specialize interpretation image called diagnostic radiologist using diagnostic image radiologist provider often diagnose cause symptom monitor well body responding treatment receiving disease condition screen different illness breast cancer colon cancer heart disease common type diagnostic radiology exam include computed tomography ct also known computerized axial tomography cat scan including ct angiography fluoroscopy including upper gi barium enema magnetic resonance imaging mri magnetic resonance angiography mra mammography nuclear medicine includes test bone scan thyroid scan thallium cardiac stress test plain includes chest positron emission tomography also called pet imaging pet scan combined ct ultrasound interventional radiology interventional radiologist doctor use imaging ct ultrasound mri fluoroscopy help guide procedure imaging helpful doctor inserting catheter wire small instrument tool body typically allows smaller incision cut provider use technology detect treat condition almost part body instead using larger incision directly looking inside body scope camera open surgery interventional radiologist often involved treating cancer tumor blockage artery vein fibroid uterus back pain liver problem kidney problem interventional radiologist make incision small one rarely need stay hospital procedure people need moderate sedation medicine help relax example interventional radiology procedure include angiography angioplasty stent placement embolization control bleeding cancer treatment including tumor embolization using chemoembolization radioembolization tumor ablation radiofrequency ablation cryoablation microwave ablation vertebroplasty kyphoplasty needle biopsy different organ lung thyroid gland breast biopsy guided either stereotactic ultrasound technique uterine artery embolization feeding tube placement venous access catheter placement port piccs

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000821.htm,Immune response,"Information The immune system protects the body from possibly harmful substances by recognizing and responding to antigens . Antigens are substances (usually proteins) on the surface of cells, viruses, fungi, or bacteria. Nonliving substances such as toxins , chemicals, drugs, and foreign particles (such as a splinter) can also be antigens. The immune system recognizes and destroys, or tries to destroy, substances that contain antigens. Your body's cells have proteins that are antigens. These include a group of antigens called HLA antigens . Your immune system learns to see these antigens as normal and usually does not react against them. INNATE IMMUNITY Innate, or nonspecific, immunity is the defense system with which you were born. It protects you against all antigens. Innate immunity involves barriers that keep harmful materials from entering your body. These barriers form the first line of defense in the immune response. Examples of innate immunity include: Cough reflex Enzymes in tears and skin oils Mucus, which traps bacteria and small particles Skin Stomach acid Innate immunity also comes in a protein chemical form, called innate humoral immunity. Examples include the body's complement system and substances called interferon and interleukin-1 (which causes fever). If an antigen gets past these barriers, it is attacked and destroyed by other parts of the immune system. ACQUIRED IMMUNITY Acquired immunity is immunity that develops with exposure to various antigens. Your immune system builds a defense against that specific antigen. Vaccines work by causing acquired immunity without needing to have the infection first. PASSIVE IMMUNITY Passive immunity is due to antibodies that are produced in a body other than your own. Infants have passive immunity because they are born with antibodies that are transferred through the placenta from their mother. These antibodies disappear between ages 6 and 12 months. Passive immunization may also be due to injection of antiserum, which contains antibodies that are formed by another person or animal. It provides immediate protection against an antigen, but does not provide long-lasting protection. Immune serum globulin (given for hepatitis exposure) and tetanus antitoxin are examples of passive immunization. BLOOD COMPONENTS The immune system includes certain types of white blood cells. It also includes chemicals and proteins in the blood, such as antibodies, complement proteins, and interferon. Some of these directly attack foreign substances in the body, and others work together to help the immune system cells. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell. There are B and T type lymphocytes. B lymphocytes become cells that produce antibodies. Antibodies attach to a specific antigen and make it easier for the immune cells to destroy the antigen. T lymphocytes attack antigens directly and help control the immune response. They also release chemicals, known as cytokines, which control the entire immune response. As lymphocytes develop, they normally learn to tell the difference between your own body tissues and substances that are not normally found in your body. Once B cells and T cells are formed, a few of those cells will multiply and provide ""memory"" for your immune system. This allows your immune system to respond faster and more efficiently the next time you are exposed to the same antigen. In many cases, it will prevent you from getting sick. For example, a person who has had chickenpox or has been immunized against chickenpox is immune from getting chickenpox again. Watch this video about: Immune response INFLAMMATION The inflammatory response (inflammation) occurs when tissues are injured by bacteria, trauma, toxins, heat, or any other cause. The damaged cells release chemicals including histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandins. These chemicals cause blood vessels to leak fluid into the tissues, causing swelling . This helps isolate the foreign substance from further contact with body tissues. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called phagocytes that ""eat"" germs and dead or damaged cells. This process is called phagocytosis. Phagocytes eventually die. Pus is formed from a collection of dead tissue, dead bacteria, and live and dead phagocytes. Watch this video about: Phagocytosis IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS AND ALLERGIES Immune system disorders occur when the immune response is directed against body tissue, is excessive (this causes auto-immune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis), or is lacking (causing immunodeficiency and increased risk of infections). Allergies involve an immune response to a substance that most people's bodies perceive as harmless. IMMUNIZATION Vaccination ( immunization ) is a way to trigger the immune response. Small doses of an antigen, such as dead or weakened live viruses or parts of a virus, are given to activate immune system ""memory"" (activated B cells and sensitized T cells). Memory allows your body to react quickly and efficiently to future exposures. Watch this video about: Vaccines COMPLICATIONS DUE TO AN ALTERED IMMUNE RESPONSE An efficient immune response protects against many diseases and disorders. An inefficient immune response allows diseases to develop. Too much, too little, or the wrong immune response causes immune system disorders. An overactive immune response can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases , in which antibodies form against the body's own tissues. Complications from altered immune responses include: Allergy or hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis , a life-threatening allergic reaction Autoimmune disorders Graft versus host disease , a complication of a

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000535.htm,Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP),"Causes ITP occurs when certain immune system cells produce antibodies against platelets. Platelets help your blood clot by clumping together to plug small holes in damaged blood vessels. The antibodies attach to the platelets. The body destroys the platelets that carry the antibodies. In children, the disease sometimes follows a viral infection. In adults, it is more often a long-term (chronic) disease and can occur after a viral infection, with use of certain medicines, during pregnancy, or as part of an immune disorder. ITP affects women more often than men. It is more common in children than adults. In children, the disease affects boys and girls equally.",causes itp occurs certain immune system cells produce antibodies platelets platelets help blood clot clumping together plug small holes damaged blood vessels antibodies attach platelets body destroys platelets carry antibodies children disease sometimes follows viral infection adults often chronic disease occur viral infection use certain medicines pregnancy part immune disorder itp affects women often men common children adults children disease affects boys girls equally,cause itp occurs certain immune system cell produce antibody platelet platelet help blood clot clumping together plug small hole damaged blood vessel antibody attach platelet body destroys platelet carry antibody child disease sometimes follows viral infection adult often chronic disease occur viral infection use certain medicine pregnancy part immune disorder itp affect woman often men common child adult child disease affect boy girl equally
https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000818.htm,Immunodeficiency disorders,"Causes The immune system is made up of lymphoid tissue in the body, which includes: Bone marrow Lymph nodes Parts of the spleen and gastrointestinal tract Thymus Tonsils Proteins and cells in the blood are also part of the immune system. The immune system helps protect the body from harmful substances called antigens . Examples of antigens include bacteria, viruses, toxins , cancer cells, and foreign blood or tissues from another person or species. Watch this video about: Immune response When the immune system detects an antigen, it responds by activating cells known as T lymphocytes, which interact with cells known as B lymphocytes. The B cells lead to production of proteins called antibodies that destroy the harmful substances. The immune system response also involves a process called phagocytosis. During this process, certain white blood cells swallow and destroy bacteria and other foreign substances. Proteins called complement help with this process. Watch this video about: Phagocytosis Immunodeficiency disorders may affect any part of the immune system. Most often, these conditions occur when the T or B lymphocytes (or both) do not function normally or your body does not produce enough antibodies. Inherited immunodeficiency disorders that affect B cells include: Hypogammaglobulinemia, which usually leads to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections Agammaglobulinemia , which results in severe infections early in life, and is often deadly Inherited immunodeficiency disorders that affect T cells may cause repeated Candida (yeast) infections. Inherited combined immunodeficiency affects both T cells and B cells. It may be deadly within the first year of life if it isn't treated early. People are said to be immunosuppressed when they have an immunodeficiency disorder due to medicines that weaken the immune system. Examples include: Corticosteroids Medicines used to treat health problems such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain skin conditions Chemotherapy given to treat cancer Acquired immunodeficiency may be a complication of diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malnutrition (especially if the person does not eat enough protein). Many cancers may also cause immunodeficiency. People who have had their spleen removed have an acquired immunodeficiency, and are at higher risk for infection by certain bacteria that the spleen would normally help fight. People with diabetes are also at higher risk for certain infections. As you get older, the immune system becomes less effective. Immune system tissues (especially lymphoid tissue such as the thymus) shrink, and the number and activity of white blood cells drop. The following are diseases of the immune system that can prevent it from functioning normally: Ataxia-telangiectasia Complement deficiencies DiGeorge syndrome Hypogammaglobulinemia Job syndrome or Hyper IgE syndrome Leukocyte adhesion defects Agammaglobulinemia Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome Comon variable immunodeficiency Severe variable immunodeficiency",causes immune system made lymphoid tissue body includes bone marrow lymph nodes parts spleen gastrointestinal tract thymus tonsils proteins cells blood also part immune system immune system helps protect body harmful substances called antigens examples antigens include bacteria viruses toxins cancer cells foreign blood tissues another person species watch video immune response immune system detects antigen responds activating cells known lymphocytes interact cells known b lymphocytes b cells lead production proteins called antibodies destroy harmful substances immune system response also involves process called phagocytosis process certain white blood cells swallow destroy bacteria foreign substances proteins called complement help process watch video phagocytosis immunodeficiency disorders may affect part immune system often conditions occur b lymphocytes function normally body produce enough antibodies inherited immunodeficiency disorders affect b cells include hypogammaglobulinemia usually leads respiratory gastrointestinal infections agammaglobulinemia results severe infections early life often deadly inherited immunodeficiency disorders affect cells may cause repeated candida yeast infections inherited combined immunodeficiency affects cells b cells may deadly within first year life treated early people said immunosuppressed immunodeficiency disorder due medicines weaken immune system examples include corticosteroids medicines used treat health problems rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease certain skin conditions chemotherapy given treat cancer acquired immunodeficiency may complication diseases malnutrition especially person eat enough protein many cancers may also cause immunodeficiency people spleen removed acquired immunodeficiency higher risk infection certain bacteria spleen would normally help fight people diabetes also higher risk certain infections get older immune system becomes less effective immune system tissues especially lymphoid tissue thymus shrink number activity white blood cells drop following diseases immune system prevent functioning normally complement deficiencies digeorge syndrome hypogammaglobulinemia job syndrome hyper ige syndrome leukocyte adhesion defects agammaglobulinemia syndrome comon variable immunodeficiency severe variable immunodeficiency,cause immune system made lymphoid tissue body includes bone marrow lymph node part spleen gastrointestinal tract thymus tonsil protein cell blood also part immune system immune system help protect body harmful substance called antigen example antigen include bacteria virus toxin cancer cell foreign blood tissue another person specie watch video immune response immune system detects antigen responds activating cell known lymphocyte interact cell known b lymphocyte b cell lead production protein called antibody destroy harmful substance immune system response also involves process called phagocytosis process certain white blood cell swallow destroy bacteria foreign substance protein called complement help process watch video phagocytosis immunodeficiency disorder may affect part immune system often condition occur b lymphocyte function normally body produce enough antibody inherited immunodeficiency disorder affect b cell include hypogammaglobulinemia usually lead respiratory gastrointestinal infection agammaglobulinemia result severe infection early life often deadly inherited immunodeficiency disorder affect cell may cause repeated candida yeast infection inherited combined immunodeficiency affect cell b cell may deadly within first year life treated early people said immunosuppressed immunodeficiency disorder due medicine weaken immune system example include corticosteroid medicine used treat health problem rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease certain skin condition chemotherapy given treat cancer acquired immunodeficiency may complication disease malnutrition especially person eat enough protein many cancer may also cause immunodeficiency people spleen removed acquired immunodeficiency higher risk infection certain bacteria spleen would normally help fight people diabetes also higher risk certain infection get older immune system becomes less effective immune system tissue especially lymphoid tissue thymus shrink number activity white blood cell drop following disease immune system prevent functioning normally complement deficiency digeorge syndrome hypogammaglobulinemia job syndrome hyper ige syndrome leukocyte adhesion defect agammaglobulinemia syndrome comon variable immunodeficiency severe variable immunodeficiency

Catch about 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 milliliters) of urine in the clean container that you are given. Remove the container from the urine stream. Give the container to the health care provider or assistant. For an infant: Thoroughly wash the area where the urine exits the body. Open a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end). For males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive to the skin. For females, place the bag over the labia. Diaper as usual over the secured bag. It may take more than one try to get a sample from an infant. An active baby can move the bag, so that the urine goes into the diaper. Check the infant often and change the bag after the urine has been collected.

Jaundice can occur if: Too many red blood cells are dying or breaking down and going to the liver. The liver is overloaded or damaged. The bilirubin from the liver is unable to move normally into the digestive tract. Jaundice is often a sign of a problem with the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000995.htm,Jaundice and breastfeeding,"Causes Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is produced as the body recycles old red blood cells. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool. It can be normal for newborn babies to be a little yellow between days 1 and 5 of life. The color most often peaks around day 3 or 4. Breast milk jaundice is seen after the first week of life. It is likely caused by: Factors in a mother's milk that help a baby absorb bilirubin from the intestine Factors that keep certain proteins in the baby's liver from breaking down bilirubin Sometimes, jaundice occurs when your baby does not get enough breast milk, instead of from the breast milk itself. This kind of jaundice is different because it starts in the first few days of life. It is called ""breastfeeding failure jaundice,"" ""breast-non-feeding jaundice,"" or even ""starvation jaundice."" Babies who are born early (before 37 or 38 weeks) are not always able to feed well. Breastfeeding failure or breast-non-feeding jaundice may also occur when feedings are scheduled by the clock (such as, every 3 hours for 10 minutes) or when babies who show signs of hunger are given pacifiers. Breast milk jaundice may run in families. It occurs just as often in males and females and affects about a third of all newborns who get only their mother's milk.",causes bilirubin yellow pigment produced body recycles old red blood cells liver helps break bilirubin removed body stool normal newborn babies little yellow days 1 5 life color often peaks around day 3 breast milk jaundice seen first week life likely caused factors mother milk help baby absorb bilirubin intestine factors keep certain proteins baby liver breaking bilirubin sometimes jaundice occurs baby get enough breast milk instead breast milk kind jaundice different starts first days life called breastfeeding failure jaundice jaundice even starvation jaundice babies born early 37 38 weeks always able feed well breastfeeding failure jaundice may also occur feedings scheduled clock every 3 hours 10 minutes babies show signs hunger given pacifiers breast milk jaundice may run families occurs often males females affects third newborns get mother milk,cause bilirubin yellow pigment produced body recycles old red blood cell liver help break bilirubin removed body stool normal newborn baby little yellow day 1 5 life color often peak around day 3 breast milk jaundice seen first week life likely caused factor mother milk help baby absorb bilirubin intestine factor keep certain protein baby liver breaking bilirubin sometimes jaundice occurs baby get enough breast milk instead breast milk kind jaundice different start first day life called breastfeeding failure jaundice jaundice even starvation jaundice baby born early 37 38 week always able feed well breastfeeding failure jaundice may also occur feeding scheduled clock every 3 hour 10 minute baby show sign hunger given pacifier breast milk jaundice may run family occurs often male female affect third newborn get mother milk

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000661.htm,Kaposi sarcoma,"Causes KS is the result of infection with a gamma herpesvirus known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), or human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8). It is in the same family as the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis . KSHV is transmitted mainly through saliva. It can also be spread through sexual contact, blood transfusion, or transplants. After it enters the body, the virus can infect different kinds of cells, especially cells that line blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. Like all herpesviruses, KSHV remains in your body for the rest of your life. If your immune system becomes weakened in the future, this virus may have the chance to reactivate, causing symptoms. There are four types of KS based on the groups of people who are infected: Classic KS: Mainly affects older men of Eastern European, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean descent. The disease usually develops slowly. Epidemic (AIDS-related) KS: Occurs most often in people who have HIV infection and have developed AIDS. Endemic (African) KS: Mainly affects people of all ages in Africa. Immunosuppression-associated, or transplantation-associated, KS: Occurs in people who have had an organ transplant and take medicines that suppress their immune system.",causes ks result infection gamma herpesvirus known kaposi herpesvirus kshv human herpesvirus 8 hhv8 family virus causes mononucleosis kshv transmitted mainly saliva also spread sexual contact blood transfusion transplants enters body virus infect different kinds cells especially cells line blood vessels lymphatic vessels like herpesviruses kshv remains body rest life immune system becomes weakened future virus may chance reactivate causing symptoms four types ks based groups people infected classic ks mainly affects older men eastern european middle eastern mediterranean descent disease usually develops slowly epidemic ks occurs often people hiv infection developed aids endemic african ks mainly affects people ages africa ks occurs people organ transplant take medicines suppress immune system,cause k result infection gamma herpesvirus known kaposi herpesvirus kshv human herpesvirus 8 hhv8 family virus cause mononucleosis kshv transmitted mainly saliva also spread sexual contact blood transfusion transplant enters body virus infect different kind cell especially cell line blood vessel lymphatic vessel like herpesviruses kshv remains body rest life immune system becomes weakened future virus may chance reactivate causing symptom four type k based group people infected classic k mainly affect older men eastern european middle eastern mediterranean descent disease usually develops slowly epidemic k occurs often people hiv infection developed aid endemic african k mainly affect people age africa k occurs people organ transplant take medicine suppress immune system

A bone marrow biopsy is needed to take a sample of bone marrow. The sample is placed into a special dish or tube and allowed to grow in the laboratory. Cells are later taken from the new sample and stained. The laboratory specialist uses a microscope to examine the size, shape, and number of chromosomes in the cell sample. The stained sample is photographed to show the arrangement of the chromosomes. This is called a karyotype. Certain problems can be identified through the number or arrangement of the chromosomes. Chromosomes contain thousands of genes that are stored in DNA, the basic genetic material.",test performed test performed almost tissue including amniotic fluid blood bone marrow tissue organ develops pregnancy feed growing baby placenta test amniotic fluid amniocentesis done bone marrow biopsy needed take sample bone marrow sample placed special dish tube allowed grow laboratory cells later taken new sample stained laboratory specialist uses microscope examine size shape number chromosomes cell sample stained sample photographed show arrangement chromosomes called karyotype certain problems identified number arrangement chromosomes chromosomes contain thousands genes stored dna basic genetic material,test performed test performed almost tissue including amniotic fluid blood bone marrow tissue organ develops pregnancy feed growing baby placenta test amniotic fluid amniocentesis done bone marrow biopsy needed take sample bone marrow sample placed special dish tube allowed grow laboratory cell later taken new sample stained laboratory specialist us microscope examine size shape number chromosome cell sample stained sample photographed show arrangement chromosome called karyotype certain problem identified number arrangement chromosome chromosome contain thousand gene stored dna basic genetic material

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003907.htm,Kidney biopsy,"How the Test is Performed A kidney biopsy is done in the hospital. The two most common ways to do a kidney biopsy are percutaneous and open. These are described below. Percutaneous biopsy. Percutaneous means through the skin. Most kidney biopsies are done this way. The procedure is usually done in the following way: You may receive medicine to make you drowsy. You lie on your stomach. If you have a transplanted kidney, you lie on your back. The health care provider marks the spot on the skin where the biopsy needle is inserted. The skin is cleaned. Numbing medicine (anesthetic) is injected under the skin near the kidney area. The provider makes a tiny cut in the skin. Ultrasound images are used to find the proper location. Sometimes another imaging method, such as CT , is used. The provider inserts a biopsy needle through the skin to the surface of the kidney. You are asked to take and hold a deep breath as the needle goes into the kidney. If the provider is not using ultrasound guidance, you may be asked to take several deep breaths. This allows the provider to know the needle is in place. The needle may be inserted more than once if more than one tissue sample is needed. The needle is removed. Pressure is applied to the biopsy site to stop any bleeding. After the procedure, a bandage is applied to the biopsy site. Open biopsy. In some cases, your provider may recommend a surgical (open) biopsy. This method is used when a larger piece of tissue is needed or a percutaneous needle biopsy cannot be done safely. You receive medicine (anesthesia) that allows you to sleep and be pain-free. The surgeon makes a small surgical cut (incision). The surgeon locates the part of the kidney from which the biopsy tissue needs to be taken. The tissue is removed. The incision is closed with stitches (sutures). After percutaneous or open biopsy, you will likely stay in the hospital for at least 12 hours. You will receive pain medicines and fluids by mouth or through a vein (IV). Your urine will be checked for heavy bleeding. A small amount of bleeding is normal after a biopsy. Follow instructions about caring for yourself after the biopsy. This may include not lifting anything heavier than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) for 2 weeks after the biopsy.",test performed kidney biopsy done hospital two common ways kidney biopsy percutaneous open described percutaneous biopsy percutaneous means skin kidney biopsies done way procedure usually done following way may receive medicine make drowsy lie stomach transplanted kidney lie back health care provider marks spot skin biopsy needle inserted skin cleaned numbing medicine anesthetic injected skin near kidney area provider makes tiny cut skin ultrasound images used find proper location sometimes another imaging method ct used provider inserts biopsy needle skin surface kidney asked take hold deep breath needle goes kidney provider using ultrasound guidance may asked take several deep breaths allows provider know needle place needle may inserted one tissue sample needed needle removed pressure applied biopsy site stop bleeding procedure bandage applied biopsy site open biopsy cases provider may recommend surgical open biopsy method used larger piece tissue needed percutaneous needle biopsy done safely receive medicine anesthesia allows sleep surgeon makes small surgical cut incision surgeon locates part kidney biopsy tissue needs taken tissue removed incision closed stitches sutures percutaneous open biopsy likely stay hospital least 12 hours receive pain medicines fluids mouth vein iv urine checked heavy bleeding small amount bleeding normal biopsy follow instructions caring biopsy may include lifting anything heavier 10 pounds kilograms 2 weeks biopsy,test performed kidney biopsy done hospital two common way kidney biopsy percutaneous open described percutaneous biopsy percutaneous mean skin kidney biopsy done way procedure usually done following way may receive medicine make drowsy lie stomach transplanted kidney lie back health care provider mark spot skin biopsy needle inserted skin cleaned numbing medicine anesthetic injected skin near kidney area provider make tiny cut skin ultrasound image used find proper location sometimes another imaging method ct used provider insert biopsy needle skin surface kidney asked take hold deep breath needle go kidney provider using ultrasound guidance may asked take several deep breath allows provider know needle place needle may inserted one tissue sample needed needle removed pressure applied biopsy site stop bleeding procedure bandage applied biopsy site open biopsy case provider may recommend surgical open biopsy method used larger piece tissue needed percutaneous needle biopsy done safely receive medicine anesthesia allows sleep surgeon make small surgical cut incision surgeon locates part kidney biopsy tissue need taken tissue removed incision closed stitch suture percutaneous open biopsy likely stay hospital least 12 hour receive pain medicine fluid mouth vein iv urine checked heavy bleeding small amount bleeding normal biopsy follow instruction caring biopsy may include lifting anything heavier 10 pound kilogram 2 week biopsy

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003001.htm,Kidney removal,"Description This surgery is done in the hospital while you are asleep and pain-free (general anesthesia). The procedure can take 3 or more hours. Simple nephrectomy or open kidney removal: You will be lying on your side. Your surgeon will make an incision (cut) up to 12 inches or 30 centimeters (cm) long. This cut will be on your side, just below the ribs or right over the lowest ribs. Muscle, fat, and tissue are cut and moved. Your surgeon may need to remove a rib to do the procedure. The tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder (ureter) and blood vessels are cut away from the kidney. The kidney is then removed. Sometimes, just a part of the kidney may be removed (partial nephrectomy). The cut is then closed with stitches or staples. Radical nephrectomy or open kidney removal: Your surgeon will make a cut about 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) long. This cut will be on the front of your belly, just below your ribs. It may also be done through your side. Muscle, fat, and tissue are cut and moved. The tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder (ureter) and blood vessels are cut away from the kidney. The kidney is then removed. Your surgeon will also take out the surrounding fat, and sometimes the adrenal gland and some lymph nodes. The cut is then closed with stitches or staples. Laparoscopic kidney removal: Your surgeon will make 3 or 4 small cuts, most often no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) each, in your belly and side. The surgeon will use tiny probes and a camera to do the surgery. Towards the end of the procedure, your surgeon will make one of the cuts larger (about 4 inches or 10 cm) to take out the kidney. The surgeon will cut the ureter, place a bag around the kidney, and pull it through the larger cut. This surgery may take longer than an open kidney removal. However, most people recover faster and feel less pain after this type of surgery when compared to the pain and recovery period following open surgery. Sometimes, your surgeon may make a cut in a different place than described above.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000458.htm,Kidney stones,"Causes Kidney stones are common. Some types run in families. They may occur at any age, including in premature infants. There are different types of kidney stones. The cause depends on the type of stone. Stones can form when urine contains too much of certain substances that form crystals. These crystals can develop into stones over weeks or months. Calcium stones are most common. They are most likely to occur in men between ages 20 to 30. Calcium can combine with other substances to form the stone. Oxalate is the most common of these substances. Oxalate is present in certain foods such as spinach. It is also found in vitamin C supplements. Diseases of the small intestine increase your risk for these stones. Calcium stones can also form by combining with phosphate or carbonate. Other types of stones include: Cystine stones can form in people who have cystinuria . This disorder runs in families. It affects both men and women. Struvite stones are mostly found in men or women who have repeated urinary tract infections . These stones can grow very large and can block the kidney, ureter, or bladder. Uric acid stones are more common in men than in women. They can occur with gout or after receiving chemotherapy for some types of cancer. Other substances, such as certain medicines, also can form stones. The biggest risk factor for kidney stones is not drinking enough fluids. Kidney stones are more likely to occur if you make less than 1 liter (32 ounces) of urine a day.",causes kidney stones common types run families may occur age including premature infants different types kidney stones cause depends type stone stones form urine contains much certain substances form crystals crystals develop stones weeks months calcium stones common likely occur men ages 20 calcium combine substances form stone oxalate common substances oxalate present certain foods spinach also found vitamin c supplements diseases small intestine increase risk stones calcium stones also form combining phosphate carbonate types stones include cystine stones form people cystinuria disorder runs families affects men women struvite stones mostly found men women repeated urinary tract infections stones grow large block kidney ureter bladder uric acid stones common men women occur gout receiving chemotherapy types cancer substances certain medicines also form stones biggest risk factor kidney stones drinking enough fluids kidney stones likely occur make less 1 liter 32 ounces urine day,cause kidney stone common type run family may occur age including premature infant different type kidney stone cause depends type stone stone form urine contains much certain substance form crystal crystal develop stone week month calcium stone common likely occur men age 20 calcium combine substance form stone oxalate common substance oxalate present certain food spinach also found vitamin c supplement disease small intestine increase risk stone calcium stone also form combining phosphate carbonate type stone include cystine stone form people cystinuria disorder run family affect men woman struvite stone mostly found men woman repeated urinary tract infection stone grow large block kidney ureter bladder uric acid stone common men woman occur gout receiving chemotherapy type cancer substance certain medicine also form stone biggest risk factor kidney stone drinking enough fluid kidney stone likely occur make less 1 liter 32 ounce urine day
https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003005.htm,Kidney transplant,"Description Kidney transplants are one of the most common transplant operations in the United States. One donated kidney is needed to replace the work previously done by your kidneys. The donated kidney may be from a: Living related donor - related to the person receiving the transplant, such as a parent, sibling, or child Living unrelated donor - such as a friend or spouse Deceased donor - a person who has recently died and who has no known chronic kidney disease The healthy kidney is transported in a special solution that preserves the organ for up to 48 hours. This gives the health care providers time to perform tests to ensure that the donor's and recipient's blood and tissue match. PROCEDURE FOR A LIVING KIDNEY DONOR If you are donating a kidney, you will be placed under general anesthesia before surgery. This means you will be asleep and pain-free. Surgeons today can often use small surgical cuts with laparoscopic techniques to remove the kidney. PROCEDURE FOR THE PERSON RECEIVING THE KIDNEY (RECIPIENT) People receiving a kidney transplant are given general anesthesia before surgery. The surgeon makes a cut in the lower belly area. Your surgeon places the new kidney inside your lower belly. The artery and vein of the new kidney are connected to the artery and vein in your pelvis. Your blood flows through the new kidney, which makes urine just like your own kidneys did when they were healthy. The tube that carries urine (ureter) is then attached to your bladder. Your own kidneys are left in place unless they are causing a medical problem. The wound is then closed. Kidney transplant surgery takes about 3 hours. People with diabetes may also have a pancreas transplant done at the same time. This can add another 3 hours to the surgery.",description kidney transplants one common transplant operations united states one donated kidney needed replace work previously done kidneys donated kidney may living related donor related person receiving transplant parent sibling child living unrelated donor friend spouse deceased donor person recently died known chronic kidney disease healthy kidney transported special solution preserves organ 48 hours gives health care providers time perform tests ensure donor recipient blood tissue match procedure living kidney donor donating kidney placed general anesthesia surgery means asleep surgeons today often use small surgical cuts laparoscopic techniques remove kidney procedure person receiving kidney recipient people receiving kidney transplant given general anesthesia surgery surgeon makes cut lower belly area surgeon places new kidney inside lower belly artery vein new kidney connected artery vein pelvis blood flows new kidney makes urine like kidneys healthy tube carries urine ureter attached bladder kidneys left place unless causing medical problem wound closed kidney transplant surgery takes 3 hours people diabetes may also pancreas transplant done time add another 3 hours surgery,description kidney transplant one common transplant operation united state one donated kidney needed replace work previously done kidney donated kidney may living related donor related person receiving transplant parent sibling child living unrelated donor friend spouse deceased donor person recently died known chronic kidney disease healthy kidney transported special solution preserve organ 48 hour give health care provider time perform test ensure donor recipient blood tissue match procedure living kidney donor donating kidney placed general anesthesia surgery mean asleep surgeon today often use small surgical cut laparoscopic technique remove kidney procedure person receiving kidney recipient people receiving kidney transplant given general anesthesia surgery surgeon make cut lower belly area surgeon place new kidney inside lower belly artery vein new kidney connected artery vein pelvis blood flow new kidney make urine like kidney healthy tube carry urine ureter attached bladder kidney left place unless causing medical problem wound closed kidney transplant surgery take 3 hour people diabetes may also pancreas transplant done time add another 3 hour surgery

The 2 sex chromosomes (X and Y) determine the genetic sex of a child. The genetic sex of a child is determined at conception. The mother's egg cell contains an X chromosome, while the father's sperm cell contains either an X or a Y chromosome. Normally, an infant inherits 1 pair of sex chromosomes, 1 X from the mother and 1 X or 1 Y from the father. A baby who inherits the X chromosome from the father is a genetic female and has 2 X chromosomes. A baby who inherits the Y chromosome from the father is a genetic male and has 1 X and 1 Y chromosome . Klinefelter syndrome results when a male child is born with at least 1 extra X chromosome. They have 47 chromosomes instead of 46. This is written as 47, XXY. Klinefelter syndrome occurs as a random event. There is no exact cause, and the condition is not inherited. Klinefelter syndrome occurs in about 1 out of 500 to 1,000 male infants.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000276.htm,Lactose intolerance,"Causes Babies' bodies make the lactase enzyme so they can digest milk, including breast milk. Babies born too early (premature) sometimes have lactose intolerance. Children who were born at full term often do not show signs of the problem before they are 3 years old. Lactose intolerance is very common in adults. It is rarely dangerous. About 30 million American adults have some degree of lactose intolerance by age 20. In white people, lactose intolerance often develops in children older than age 5. This is the age when our bodies may stop making lactase. In African Americans, the problem can occur as early as age 2. The condition is very common among adults with Asian, African, or Native American heritage.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003500.htm,Lactose tolerance tests,"How the Test is Performed Two common methods include: Lactose tolerance blood test Hydrogen breath test The hydrogen breath test is the preferred method. It measures the amount of hydrogen in the air you breathe out. You will be asked to breathe into a balloon-type container. You will then drink a flavored liquid containing lactose. Samples of your breath are taken at set times and the hydrogen level is checked. Normally, very little hydrogen is in your breath. But if your body has trouble breaking down and absorbing lactose, breath hydrogen levels increase. The lactose tolerance blood test looks for glucose in your blood. Your body creates glucose when lactose breaks down. For this test, several blood samples will be taken before and after you drink a liquid containing lactose. A blood sample will be taken from a vein in your arm ( venipuncture ).",test performed two common methods include lactose tolerance blood test hydrogen breath test hydrogen breath test preferred method measures amount hydrogen air breathe asked breathe container drink flavored liquid containing lactose samples breath taken set times hydrogen level checked normally little hydrogen breath body trouble breaking absorbing lactose breath hydrogen levels increase lactose tolerance blood test looks glucose blood body creates glucose lactose breaks test several blood samples taken drink liquid containing lactose blood sample taken vein arm venipuncture,test performed two common method include lactose tolerance blood test hydrogen breath test hydrogen breath test preferred method measure amount hydrogen air breathe asked breathe container drink flavored liquid containing lactose sample breath taken set time hydrogen level checked normally little hydrogen breath body trouble breaking absorbing lactose breath hydrogen level increase lactose tolerance blood test look glucose blood body creates glucose lactose break test several blood sample taken drink liquid containing lactose blood sample taken vein arm venipuncture

This means your immune system mistakenly targets healthy cells and tissues in the body. With LEMS, antibodies produced by the immune system attack nerve cells. This makes nerves cells unable to release enough of a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical transmits impulses between nerves and muscles. The result is muscle weakness. LEMS may occur with cancers such as small cell lung cancer or autoimmune disorders such as vitiligo , which leads to a loss of skin pigment. LEMS affects men more often than women.

To develop language, a child must be able to hear, see, understand, and remember. Children must also be physically able to form speech. Up to 1 of every 14 children has symptoms of a language disorder. When the cause is unknown, it is called a developmental language disorder. Problems with receptive language skills usually begin before age 4. Some mixed language disorders are caused by a brain injury. These conditions are sometimes misdiagnosed as developmental disorders. Language disorders may occur in children with: Other developmental problems Autism spectrum disorder Hearing loss Learning disabilities Damage to the central nervous system, which is called aphasia Language disorders are rarely caused by a lack of intelligence. Language disorders are not the same as delayed language. With delayed language, the child develops speech and language in the same way as other children, but later. In language disorders, speech and language do not develop normally. The child may have some language skills, but not others.

A laparoscope is a thin, lighted tube that lets your surgeon see inside your belly. Gallbladder removal surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia so you will be asleep and pain-free. The operation is done the following way: Your surgeon makes 3 to 4 small cuts in your belly. The laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts. Other medical instruments are inserted through the other cuts. Gas is pumped into your belly to expand the space. This gives your surgeon more room to see and work. The gallbladder is then removed using the laparoscope and other instruments. An x-ray called a cholangiogram may be done during your surgery. To do this test, dye is injected into your common bile duct and an x-ray picture is taken. The dye helps find stones that may be in the common bile duct. If other stones are found, your surgeon will remove them with a special instrument. Sometimes your surgeon cannot safely take out the gallbladder using a laparoscope.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002941.htm,Large bowel resection,"Description You'll receive general anesthesia at the time of your surgery. This will keep you asleep and pain-free. The surgery can be performed laparoscopically or with open surgery. Depending on which surgery you have, the surgeon will make one or more cuts (incisions) in your belly. If you have laparoscopic surgery: The surgeon makes 3 to 5 small cuts (incisions) in your belly. A medical device called a laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts. The scope is a thin, lighted tube with a camera on the end. It lets the surgeon see inside your belly. Other medical instruments are inserted through the other cuts. A cut of about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 centimeters) may also be made if your surgeon needs to put their hand inside your belly to feel or remove the diseased bowel. Your belly is filled with a harmless gas to expand it. This makes the area easier for the surgeon to see and work in. The surgeon examines the organs in your belly to see if there are any problems. The diseased part of your large bowel is located and removed. Some lymph nodes may also be removed. If you have open surgery: The surgeon makes a cut of 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 centimeters) in your lower belly. The organs in your belly are examined to see if there are any problems. The diseased part of your large bowel is located and removed. Some lymph nodes may also be removed. In both kinds of surgery, the next steps are: If there is enough healthy large intestine left, the ends are stitched or stapled together. This is called an anastomosis. Most patients have this done. If there is not enough healthy large intestine to reconnect, the surgeon makes an opening called a stoma through the skin of your belly. The colon is attached to the outer wall of your belly. Stool will go through the stoma into a drainage bag outside your body. This is called a colostomy . The colostomy may be either short-term or permanent.

Before birth LGA measurements are obtained by ultrasound exam. In an ultrasound exam obtained close to term, the exam is not as accurate and may suggest LGA in some cases where the baby is growing normally. You should talk with your health care provider about this issue.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007398.htm,Laryngectomy,"Description Laryngectomy is major surgery that is done in the hospital. Before surgery you will receive general anesthesia . You will be asleep and pain-free. Total laryngectomy removes the whole larynx. Part of your pharynx may be taken out as well. Your pharynx is the mucous membrane-lined passage between your nasal passages and esophagus. The surgeon will make a cut in your neck to open up the area. Care is taken to preserve major blood vessels and other important structures. The larynx and tissue around it will be removed. The lymph nodes may also be removed. The surgeon will then make an opening in your trachea and a hole in front of your neck. Your trachea will be attached to this hole. The hole is called a stoma. After surgery you will breathe through your stoma. It will never be removed. Your esophagus, muscles, and skin will be closed with stitches or clips. You may have tubes coming from your wound for a while after surgery. The surgeon may also do a tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP). A TEP is a small hole in your windpipe (trachea) and the tube that moves food from your throat to your stomach (esophagus). Your surgeon will place a small man-made part (prosthesis) into this opening. The prosthesis will allow you to speak after your voice box has been removed. There are many less invasive surgeries to remove part of the larynx. The names of some of these procedures are endoscopic (or transoral resection), vertical partial laryngectomy, horizontal or supraglottic partial laryngectomy, and supracricoid partial laryngectomy. These procedures may work for some people. The surgery you have depends on how much your cancer has spread and what type of cancer you have.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000621.htm,Malaria,"Causes Malaria is caused by a parasite. It is passed to humans by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. After infection, the parasites (called sporozoites) travel through the bloodstream to the liver. There, they mature and release another form of parasites, called merozoites. The parasites enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells (RBCs). The parasites multiply inside the red blood cells. The cells then break open within 48 to 72 hours and infect more red blood cells. The first symptoms usually occur 2 to 4 weeks after infection, though they can appear as early as 8 days or as long as a year after infection. The symptoms occur in cycles of 48 to 72 hours. Most symptoms are caused by: The release of merozoites into the bloodstream Anemia resulting from the destruction of the red blood cells Large amounts of free hemoglobin being released into circulation after red blood cells break open, which can damage other organs such as the kidneys Malaria can also be transmitted from a mother to her unborn baby (congenitally) and by blood transfusions. Malaria can be carried by mosquitoes in temperate climates, but the parasite disappears over the winter. The disease is a major health problem in much of the tropics and subtropics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2020 there were about 241 million cases of malaria. About 627,000 people died of it. Malaria is a major disease hazard for travelers to warm climates. In some areas of the world, mosquitoes that carry malaria have developed resistance to insecticides. In addition, the parasites have developed resistance to some antibiotics. These conditions have made it hard to control both the rate of infection and spread of this disease.",causes malaria caused parasite passed humans bite infected anopheles mosquitoes infection parasites called sporozoites travel bloodstream liver mature release another form parasites called merozoites parasites enter bloodstream infect red blood cells rbcs parasites multiply inside red blood cells cells break open within 48 72 hours infect red blood cells first symptoms usually occur 2 4 weeks infection though appear early 8 days long year infection symptoms occur cycles 48 72 hours symptoms caused release merozoites bloodstream anemia resulting destruction red blood cells large amounts free hemoglobin released circulation red blood cells break open damage organs kidneys malaria also transmitted mother unborn baby congenitally blood transfusions malaria carried mosquitoes temperate climates parasite disappears winter disease major health problem much tropics subtropics centers disease control prevention reported 2020 241 million cases malaria people died malaria major disease hazard travelers warm climates areas world mosquitoes carry malaria developed resistance insecticides addition parasites developed resistance antibiotics conditions made hard control rate infection spread disease,cause malaria caused parasite passed human bite infected anopheles mosquito infection parasite called sporozoite travel bloodstream liver mature release another form parasite called merozoite parasite enter bloodstream infect red blood cell rbc parasite multiply inside red blood cell cell break open within 48 72 hour infect red blood cell first symptom usually occur 2 4 week infection though appear early 8 day long year infection symptom occur cycle 48 72 hour symptom caused release merozoite bloodstream anemia resulting destruction red blood cell large amount free hemoglobin released circulation red blood cell break open damage organ kidney malaria also transmitted mother unborn baby congenitally blood transfusion malaria carried mosquito temperate climate parasite disappears winter disease major health problem much tropic subtropics center disease control prevention reported 2020 241 million case malaria people died malaria major disease hazard traveler warm climate area world mosquito carry malaria developed resistance insecticide addition parasite developed resistance antibiotic condition made hard control rate infection spread disease

Light rays are focused in front of the retina, rather than directly on it. As a result, what you see is blurry. Most of the eye's focusing power comes from the cornea. Watch this video about: Seeing Nearsightedness affects males and females equally. People who have a family history of nearsightedness are more likely to develop it.

All the tissue on the side of the neck from the jawbone to the collarbone is removed. The muscle, nerve, salivary gland, and major blood vessel in this area are all removed. Modified radical neck dissection. This is the most common type of neck dissection. All lymph nodes are removed. Less neck tissue is taken out than with radical dissection.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007297.htm,Obesity,"Causes Taking in more calories than your body uses can lead to obesity. This is because your body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by: Eating more food than your body can use Drinking too much alcohol Not getting enough exercise Many people with obesity who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost. Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods develop obesity, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work as well as it should. The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults. The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat. We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active. Many people feel they do not have time to plan and make healthy meals. Many people do not have ready access to healthy foods making it difficult to plan and make healthy meals. More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past. People with little free time may have less time to exercise. The term eating disorder means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may have obesity, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time. Sometimes, medical problems or treatments cause or contribute to weight gain, including: Underactive thyroid ( hypothyroidism ) Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics Other things that can cause weight gain are: Quitting smoking -- Many people who quit smoking gain 4 to 10 pounds (lb) or 2 to 5 kilograms (kg) in the first 6 months after quitting. Stress, anxiety, feeling sad, depression, or not sleeping well. Menopause -- Women may gain 12 to 15 lb (5.5 to 7 kg) during menopause.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000085.htm,Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS),"Causes The exact cause of OHS is not known. It is believed that OHS results from a defect in the brain's control over breathing.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007508.htm,Obesity in children,"Causes When children eat more food than their bodies need for normal growth and activity, the extra calories are stored in fat cells for later use. If this pattern continues over time, they develop more fat cells and may develop obesity. Normally, infants and young children respond to signals of hunger and fullness so that they do not consume more calories than their bodies need. However, changes over the last few decades in lifestyle and food choices have led to the rise of obesity among children . Children are surrounded by many things that make it easy to overeat and harder to be active. Foods that are high in fat and sugar content often come in large portion sizes. These factors can lead children to take in more calories than they need before they feel full. TV commercials and other screen ads can lead to unhealthy food choices . Most of the time, the food in ads aimed at children is high in sugar, salt, or fats. "" Screen time "" activities such as watching television, gaming, texting, and playing on the computer require very little energy. They often take the place of healthy physical exercise. Also, children tend to crave unhealthy snack foods they see in TV ads. Other factors in the child's environment can also lead to obesity. Family, friends, and school setting help shape a child's diet and exercise choices. Food may be used as a reward or to comfort a child. These learned habits can lead to overeating. Many people have a hard time breaking these habits later in life. Genetics, medical conditions, and emotional disorders can also increase a child's risk for obesity. Hormone disorders or low thyroid function, and certain medicines, such as steroids or anti-seizure medicines, can increase a child's appetite. Over time, this increases their risk for obesity. An unhealthy focus on eating, weight, and body image can lead to an eating disorder. Obesity and eating disorders often occur at the same time in teenage girls and young adult women who may be unhappy with their body image.",causes children eat food bodies need normal growth activity extra calories stored fat cells later use pattern continues time develop fat cells may develop obesity normally infants young children respond signals hunger fullness consume calories bodies need however changes last decades lifestyle food choices led rise obesity among children children surrounded many things make easy overeat harder active foods high fat sugar content often come large portion sizes factors lead children take calories need feel full tv commercials screen ads lead unhealthy food choices time food ads aimed children high sugar salt screen time activities watching television gaming texting playing computer require little energy often take place healthy physical exercise also children tend crave unhealthy snack foods see tv ads factors child environment also lead obesity family friends school setting help shape child diet exercise choices food may used reward comfort child learned habits lead overeating many people hard time breaking habits later life genetics medical conditions emotional disorders also increase child risk obesity hormone disorders low thyroid function certain medicines steroids medicines increase child appetite time increases risk obesity unhealthy focus eating weight body image lead eating disorder obesity eating disorders often occur time teenage girls young adult women may unhappy body image,cause child eat food body need normal growth activity extra calorie stored fat cell later use pattern continues time develop fat cell may develop obesity normally infant young child respond signal hunger fullness consume calorie body need however change last decade lifestyle food choice led rise obesity among child child surrounded many thing make easy overeat harder active food high fat sugar content often come large portion size factor lead child take calorie need feel full tv commercial screen ad lead unhealthy food choice time food ad aimed child high sugar salt screen time activity watching television gaming texting playing computer require little energy often take place healthy physical exercise also child tend crave unhealthy snack food see tv ad factor child environment also lead obesity family friend school setting help shape child diet exercise choice food may used reward comfort child learned habit lead overeating many people hard time breaking habit later life genetics medical condition emotional disorder also increase child risk obesity hormone disorder low thyroid function certain medicine steroid medicine increase child appetite time increase risk obesity unhealthy focus eating weight body image lead eating disorder obesity eating disorder often occur time teenage girl young adult woman may unhappy body image

This includes the muscles that help keep your throat open so air can flow into your lungs. Normally, your throat remains open enough during sleep to let air pass by. Some people have a narrow throat. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea. Loud snoring is a telltale symptom of OSA. Snoring is caused by air squeezing through the narrowed or blocked airway. Not everyone who snores has OSA though.

The child's intestines usually stick out (protrude) through the hole. The condition looks similar to gastroschisis . An omphalocele is a birth defect in which the infant's intestine or other abdominal organs protrude through a hole in the belly button area and are covered with a membrane. In gastroschisis, there is no covering membrane. Abdominal wall defects develop as a baby grows inside the mother's womb. During development, the intestines and other organs (liver, bladder, stomach, and ovaries or testes) develop outside the body at first and then usually return inside. In babies with omphalocele, the intestines and other organs remain outside the abdominal wall, with a membrane covering them. The exact cause for abdominal wall defects is not known. Infants with an omphalocele often have other birth defects. Defects include genetic problems (chromosomal abnormalities), congenital diaphragmatic hernia , and heart and kidney defects.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002938.htm,Omphalocele repair,"Description The goal of the procedure is to place the organs back into the baby's belly and fix the defect. Repair may be done right after the baby is born. This is called a primary repair. Or, the repair is done in stages. This is called a staged repair. Surgery for primary repair is most often done for a small omphalocele. Right after birth, the sac with the organs outside the belly is covered with a sterile dressing to protect it. When the doctors determine your newborn is strong enough for surgery, your baby is prepared for the operation. Your baby receives general anesthesia . This is medicine that allows your baby to sleep and be pain-free during the operation. The surgeon makes a cut (incision) to remove the sac around the organs. The organs are examined closely for signs of damage or other birth defects. Unhealthy parts are removed. The healthy edges are stitched together. The organs are placed back into the belly. The opening in the wall of the belly is repaired. Staged repair is done when your baby isn't stable enough for primary repair. Or, it is done if the omphalocele is very large and the organs can't fit into the baby's belly. The repair is performed the following way: Right after birth, a plastic pouch (called a silo) or a mesh-type of material is used to contain the omphalocele. The pouch or mesh is then attached to the baby's belly. Every 2 to 3 days, the doctor gently tightens the pouch or mesh to push the intestine into the belly. It may take up to 2 weeks or more for all of the organs to be back inside the belly. The pouch or mesh is then removed.

The area is opened up so your surgeon can view the gallbladder and separate it from the other organs. Your surgeon cuts the bile duct and blood vessels that lead to the gallbladder. The gallbladder is gently lifted out and removed from your body. An x-ray called a cholangiogram may be done during your surgery. To do this test, dye is injected into your common bile duct and an x-ray is taken. The dye helps find stones that may be inside the common bile duct.

The provider views the back of the eye through a lens held close to your eye. Some pressure may be applied to the eye using a small, blunt probe. You will be asked to look in various directions. This exam is usually used to look for a detached retina . Slit-lamp ophthalmoscopy . You will sit in a chair with the instrument placed in front of you. You will be asked to rest your chin and forehead on a support to keep your head steady. The provider will use the microscope part of the slit lamp and a tiny lens placed close to the front of the eye.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007489.htm,Pain medications - narcotics,"Information Narcotics work by binding to receptors in the brain, which blocks the feeling of pain. You should not use a narcotic drug for more than 3 to 4 months, unless your provider instructs you otherwise. NAMES OF COMMON NARCOTICS Codeine Fentanyl -- available as a patch, lozenge, or lollipop Hydrocodone Hydromorphone Meperidine Morphine Oxycodone Tramadol TAKING NARCOTICS Narcotic pain medicines may be prescribed to treat: Acute pain, such as from injuries, surgery or other procedures, and other short-term medical problems. Chronic pain, present for 3 months or more. This type of pain may be due to injuries or diseases involving the nervous system, as well as many other chronic conditions. There are often a wide variety of non-narcotic or nonopioid treatments. Pharmacotherapy options are available to treat both types of pain. These drugs can be abused and habit-forming. Always take narcotics as prescribed. Your provider may suggest that you take your medicine only when you feel pain. Or, your provider may suggest taking a narcotic on a regular schedule. Allowing the medicine to wear off before taking more of it can make the pain more difficult to control. Contact your provider right away if you feel you are addicted to the drug. A sign of addiction is a strong craving for the drug that you can't control. Taking narcotics to control the pain of cancer or other medical problems does not itself lead to addiction. Store narcotics safely and securely in your home. You may need a pain specialist to help you manage long-term pain. SIDE EFFECTS OF NARCOTICS Drowsiness and impaired judgment often occur with these medicines. When taking a narcotic, do not drink alcohol, drive, or operate heavy machinery. You can relieve itching by reducing the dose or talking to your provider about switching medicines. To help with constipation, drink more fluids, get more exercise, eat foods with extra fiber, and use stool softeners. If nausea or vomiting occur, try taking the narcotic with food. Withdrawal symptoms are common when you stop taking a narcotic. Symptoms include strong desire for the medicine (craving), yawning, insomnia, restlessness, mood swings, or diarrhea. To prevent withdrawal symptoms, your provider may recommend you gradually lower the dosage over time. OVERDOSE RISK Opioid overdose is a major risk if you take a narcotic drug for a long time. Before you are prescribed a narcotic, your provider may first do the following: Screen you to see if you are at risk for or already have an opioid use problem.

In many cases, this defect goes undetected and causes no problems. The cause of the defect is unknown. As a baby develops in the womb (uterus), two separate pieces of tissue join together to form the pancreas. Each part has a tube, called a duct. When the parts join together, a final duct, called the pancreatic duct, is formed. Fluid and digestive juices (enzymes) produced by the pancreas normally flow through this duct. Pancreas divisum occurs if the ducts do not join while the baby develops. Fluid from the two parts of the pancreas drains into separate areas of the upper portion of the small intestine (duodenum). This occurs in 5% to 15% of people. If a pancreatic duct becomes blocked, swelling and tissue damage (pancreatitis) may develop.",causes pancreas divisum common birth defect pancreas many cases defect goes undetected causes problems cause defect unknown baby develops womb uterus two separate pieces tissue join together form pancreas part tube called duct parts join together final duct called pancreatic duct formed fluid digestive juices enzymes produced pancreas normally flow duct pancreas divisum occurs ducts join baby develops fluid two parts pancreas drains separate areas upper portion small intestine duodenum occurs 5 15 people pancreatic duct becomes blocked swelling tissue damage pancreatitis may develop,cause pancreas divisum common birth defect pancreas many case defect go undetected cause problem cause defect unknown baby develops womb uterus two separate piece tissue join together form pancreas part tube called duct part join together final duct called pancreatic duct formed fluid digestive juice enzyme produced pancreas normally flow duct pancreas divisum occurs duct join baby develops fluid two part pancreas drain separate area upper portion small intestine duodenum occurs 5 15 people pancreatic duct becomes blocked swelling tissue damage pancreatitis may develop

The virus travels from the wound to the brain, where it causes swelling or inflammation. This inflammation leads to symptoms of the disease. Most rabies deaths occur in children. In the past, human rabies cases in the United States usually resulted from a dog bite. Recently, more cases of human rabies have been linked to bats and raccoons. Dog bites are a common cause of rabies in developing countries, especially Asia and Africa. There have been no reports of rabies caused by dog bites in the United States for a number of years due to widespread animal vaccination. Other wild animals that can spread the rabies virus include: Foxes Skunks Bats Bats can spread rabies through minor or unrecognized bites or scratches. Bites can be so small you may not realize you have been bitten. If you find a bat in your home, you should contact your health care provider or health department, even if you don't feel or see a bite. They can advise you about whether you need treatment.

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000026.htm,Radiation sickness,"Considerations Radiation sickness results when humans (or other animals) are exposed to very large doses of ionizing radiation. Radiation exposure can occur as a single large exposure ( acute ). Or it can occur as a series of small exposures spread over time ( chronic ). Exposure may be accidental or intentional (as in radiation therapy for disease treatment). Radiation sickness is generally associated with acute exposure and has a characteristic set of symptoms that appear in an orderly fashion. Chronic exposure is usually associated with delayed medical problems such as cancer and premature aging, which may happen over a long period of time. The risk for cancer depends on the dose and begins to build up, even with very low doses. There is no ""minimum threshold."" On average, Americans receive a radiation dose of about 0.62 rem (620 millirem) each year. Half of this dose comes from natural background radiation. Exposure from x-rays or gamma rays is measured in units of roentgens or millisieverts ( mSv): 10 millisieverts equal 1 roentgen, (abbreviated rad or simply R). A single chest x-ray exposes the patient to about 0.1 mSv, or 0.01 rad. A CT scan of the abdomen (belly) and pelvis exposes a person to about 10 mSv, or 1 rad. Total body exposure of 50 to100 roentgens/rad or 0.5 to1 Gray unit (Gy), equal to 500 to1,000 mSv causes radiation sickness. Total body exposure of 400 roentgens/rad (or 4 Gy) causes radiation sickness and death in half of the individuals who are exposed. Without medical treatment, nearly everyone who receives more than this amount of radiation will die within 30 days. 100,000 roentgens/rad (1,000 Gy) causes almost immediate unconsciousness and death within an hour. The severity of symptoms and illness (acute radiation sickness) depends on the type and amount of radiation, how long you were exposed, and which part of the body was exposed. Symptoms of radiation sickness may occur right after exposure, or over the next few days, weeks, or months. Bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract are especially sensitive to radiation injury. Children and babies still in the womb are more likely to be severely injured by radiation. Because it is difficult to determine the amount of radiation exposure from nuclear accidents, the best signs of the severity of the exposure are: the length of time between the exposure and the onset of symptoms, the severity of symptoms, and severity of changes in white blood cells. If a person vomits less than an hour after being exposed, that usually means the radiation dose received is very high and death may be expected. Children who receive radiation treatments or who are accidentally exposed to radiation will be treated based on their symptoms and their blood cell counts. Frequent blood studies are necessary and require a small puncture through the skin into a vein to obtain blood samples.",considerations radiation sickness results humans animals exposed large doses ionizing radiation radiation exposure occur single large exposure acute occur series small exposures spread time chronic exposure may accidental intentional radiation therapy disease treatment radiation sickness generally associated acute exposure characteristic set symptoms appear orderly fashion chronic exposure usually associated delayed medical problems cancer premature aging may happen long period time risk cancer depends dose begins build even low doses minimum threshold average americans receive radiation dose rem 620 millirem year half dose comes natural background radiation exposure gamma rays measured units roentgens millisieverts msv 10 millisieverts equal 1 roentgen abbreviated rad simply r single chest exposes patient msv rad ct scan abdomen belly pelvis exposes person 10 msv 1 rad total body exposure 50 to100 to1 gray unit gy equal 500 msv causes radiation sickness total body exposure 400 4 gy causes radiation sickness death half individuals exposed without medical treatment nearly everyone receives amount radiation die within 30 days gy causes almost immediate unconsciousness death within hour severity symptoms illness acute radiation sickness depends type amount radiation long exposed part body exposed symptoms radiation sickness may occur right exposure next days weeks months bone marrow gastrointestinal tract especially sensitive radiation injury children babies still womb likely severely injured radiation difficult determine amount radiation exposure nuclear accidents best signs severity exposure length time exposure onset symptoms severity symptoms severity changes white blood cells person vomits less hour exposed usually means radiation dose received high death may expected children receive radiation treatments accidentally exposed radiation treated based symptoms blood cell counts frequent blood studies necessary require small puncture skin vein obtain blood samples,consideration radiation sickness result human animal exposed large dos ionizing radiation radiation exposure occur single large exposure acute occur series small exposure spread time chronic exposure may accidental intentional radiation therapy disease treatment radiation sickness generally associated acute exposure characteristic set symptom appear orderly fashion chronic exposure usually associated delayed medical problem cancer premature aging may happen long period time risk cancer depends dose begin build even low dos minimum threshold average american receive radiation dose rem 620 millirem year half dose come natural background radiation exposure gamma ray measured unit roentgen millisieverts msv 10 millisieverts equal 1 roentgen abbreviated rad simply r single chest expose patient msv rad ct scan abdomen belly pelvis expose person 10 msv 1 rad total body exposure 50 to100 to1 gray unit gy equal 500 msv cause radiation sickness total body exposure 400 4 gy cause radiation sickness death half individual exposed without medical treatment nearly everyone receives amount radiation die within 30 day gy cause almost immediate unconsciousness death within hour severity symptom illness acute radiation sickness depends type amount radiation long exposed part body exposed symptom radiation sickness may occur right exposure next day week month bone marrow gastrointestinal tract especially sensitive radiation injury child baby still womb likely severely injured radiation difficult determine amount radiation exposure nuclear accident best sign severity exposure length time exposure onset symptom severity symptom severity change white blood cell person vomit less hour exposed usually mean radiation dose received high death may expected child receive radiation treatment accidentally exposed radiation treated based symptom blood cell count frequent blood study necessary require small puncture skin vein obtain blood sample
https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001918.htm,Radiation therapy,"Information Cancer cells multiply faster than normal cells in the body. Because radiation is most harmful to quickly growing cells, radiation therapy damages cancer cells more than normal cells. This prevents the cancer cells from growing and dividing, and leads to cell death. Radiation therapy is used to fight many types of cancer and to treat some benign diseases. Sometimes, radiation is the only treatment needed. It may also be used in combination with other therapies such as surgery or chemotherapy to: Shrink a tumor as much as possible before surgery Help prevent the cancer from coming back after surgery or chemotherapy Relieve symptoms caused by a tumor, such as pain, pressure, or bleeding Treat cancers that cannot be removed with surgery Treat cancers instead of using surgery TYPES OF RADIATION THERAPY Different types of radiation therapy include external, internal, and intraoperative. EXTERNAL RADIATION THERAPY External radiation is the most common form. This method carefully aims high-powered radiation or particles directly at the tumor from outside of the body. Newer methods provide more effective treatment with less tissue damage. These include: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) 3D Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT) Electron Beam Therapy Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) Stereotactic radiotherapy (radiosurgery) Proton therapy is another kind of radiation used to treat cancer. Rather than using radiation to destroy cancer cells, proton therapy uses a beam of special particles called protons. Because it causes less damage to healthy tissue, proton therapy is often used for cancers that are very close to critical parts of the body. It is only used for certain types of cancer. INTERNAL RADIATION THERAPY Internal beam radiation is placed inside your body. One method uses radioactive seeds that are placed directly into or near the tumor. This method is called brachytherapy , and is used to treat prostate cancer . It is used less often to treat breast, cervical, lung, skin, and other cancers. Another method involves receiving a specific radioactive liquid that emits radiation, called a radio nucleotide. This liquid radiation can be given in a drink with a pill, or through an IV. Liquid radiation travels throughout your body, seeking out and killing cancer cells. Thyroid cancer and some metastatic cancers such as prostate can be treated using liquid radiation. INTRAOPERTIVE RADIATION THERAPY (IORT) This type of radiation is usually used during surgery to remove a tumor. Right after the tumor is removed and before the surgeon closes the incision, radiation is delivered to the site where the tumor used to be. IORT is generally used for tumors that have not spread and microscopic tumor cells may remain after the larger tumor is removed. Compared with external radiation, advantages of IORT may include: Only the tumor area is targeted so there is less harm to healthy tissue Only a single dose of radiation is given Delivers a smaller dose of radiation SIDE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY Radiation therapy can also damage or kill healthy cells. The death of healthy cells can lead to side effects. These side effects depend on the dose of radiation, and how often you have the therapy. External beam radiation may cause skin changes, such as hair loss, red or burning skin, thinning of skin tissue, or even shedding of the outer layer of skin. Other side effects depend on the part of the body receiving radiation: Abdomen Brain Breast Chest Mouth and neck Pelvic (between the hips) Prostate",information cancer cells multiply faster normal

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007300.htm,Radical prostatectomy,"Description There are 4 main types or techniques of radical prostatectomy surgery. These procedures take about 2 to 4 hours: Retropubic -- Your surgeon will make a cut starting just below your belly button that reaches to your pubic bone. This surgery takes 90 minutes to 4 hours. Laparoscopic -- Your surgeon makes several small cuts instead of one big cut. Long, thin tools are placed inside the cuts. The surgeon puts a thin tube with a video camera (laparoscope) inside one of the cuts. This allows your surgeon to see inside your belly during the procedure. Robotic surgery -- Laparoscopic surgery is performed using a robotic system. Your surgeon moves the instruments and camera using robotic arms while sitting at a control console near the operating table. Not every hospital offers robotic surgery. Perineal -- Your surgeon makes a cut in the skin between your anus and the base of the scrotum (the perineum). The cut is smaller than with the retropubic technique. This type of surgery often takes less time and causes less loss of blood. However, it is harder for your surgeon to avoid damaging the nerves around the prostate or to remove nearby lymph nodes with this technique. This surgery is rarely done. For these procedures, you may have general anesthesia so that you are asleep and pain free. Or, you will get medicine to numb the lower half of your body (spinal or epidural anesthesia). Your surgeon removes the prostate gland from the surrounding tissue. The seminal vesicles, two small fluid-filled sacs next to your prostate, are also removed. Your surgeon will take care to cause as little damage as possible to the nerves and blood vessels. Your surgeon reattaches the urethra to a part of the bladder called the bladder neck. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out through the penis. Your surgeon may also remove lymph nodes in the pelvis to check them for cancer. A drain, called a Jackson-Pratt drain, may be left in your belly to drain extra fluid after surgery. A tube (catheter) is left in your urethra and bladder to drain urine. This will stay in place for a few days to a few weeks.",description 4 main types techniques radical prostatectomy surgery procedures take 2 4 hours retropubic surgeon make cut starting belly button reaches pubic bone surgery takes 90 minutes 4 hours laparoscopic surgeon makes several small cuts instead one big cut long thin tools placed inside cuts surgeon puts thin tube video camera laparoscope inside one cuts allows surgeon see inside belly procedure robotic surgery laparoscopic surgery performed using robotic system surgeon moves instruments camera using robotic arms sitting control console near operating table every hospital offers robotic surgery perineal surgeon makes cut skin anus base scrotum perineum cut smaller retropubic technique type surgery often takes less time causes less loss blood however harder surgeon avoid damaging nerves around prostate remove nearby lymph nodes technique surgery rarely done procedures may general anesthesia asleep pain free get medicine numb lower half body spinal epidural anesthesia surgeon removes prostate gland surrounding tissue seminal vesicles two small sacs next prostate also removed surgeon take care cause little damage possible nerves blood vessels surgeon reattaches urethra part bladder called bladder neck urethra tube carries urine bladder penis surgeon may also remove lymph nodes pelvis check cancer drain called drain may left belly drain extra fluid surgery tube catheter left urethra bladder drain urine stay place days weeks,description 4 main type technique radical prostatectomy surgery procedure take 2 4 hour retropubic surgeon make cut starting belly button reach pubic bone surgery take 90 minute 4 hour laparoscopic surgeon make several small cut instead one big cut long thin tool placed inside cut surgeon put thin tube video camera laparoscope inside one cut allows surgeon see inside belly procedure robotic surgery laparoscopic surgery performed using robotic system surgeon move instrument camera using robotic arm sitting control console near operating table every hospital offer robotic surgery perineal surgeon make cut skin anus base scrotum perineum cut smaller retropubic technique type surgery often take less time cause less loss blood however harder surgeon avoid damaging nerve around prostate remove nearby lymph node technique surgery rarely done procedure may general anesthesia asleep pain free get medicine numb lower half body spinal epidural anesthesia surgeon remove prostate gland surrounding tissue seminal vesicle two small sac next prostate also removed surgeon take care cause little damage possible nerve blood vessel surgeon reattaches urethra part bladder called bladder neck urethra tube carry urine bladder penis surgeon may also remove lymph node pelvis check cancer drain called drain may left belly drain extra fluid surgery tube catheter left urethra bladder drain urine stay place day week
https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003689.htm,Radioactive iodine uptake,"How the Test is Performed The test is done in this way: You are given a pill that contains a tiny amount of radioactive iodine. After swallowing it, you wait as the iodine collects in the thyroid. The first uptake is usually done 4 to 6 hours after you take the iodine pill. Another uptake is usually done 24 hours later. During the uptake, you lie on your back on a table. A device called a gamma probe is moved back and forth over the area of your neck where the thyroid gland is located. The probe detects the location and intensity of the rays given off by the radioactive material. A computer displays how much of the tracer is taken up by the thyroid gland. The test takes less than 30 minutes, but you will need to come back twice to have the scans performed.",test performed test done way given pill contains tiny amount radioactive iodine swallowing wait iodine collects thyroid first uptake usually done 4 6 hours take iodine pill another uptake usually done 24 hours later uptake lie back table device called gamma probe moved back forth area neck thyroid gland located probe detects location intensity rays given radioactive material computer displays much tracer taken thyroid gland test takes less 30 minutes need come back twice scans performed,test performed test done way given pill contains tiny amount radioactive iodine swallowing wait iodine collect thyroid first uptake usually done 4 6 hour take iodine pill another uptake usually done 24 hour later uptake lie back table device called gamma probe moved back forth area neck thyroid gland located probe detects location intensity ray given radioactive material computer display much tracer taken thyroid gland test take less 30 minute need come back twice scan performed
https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007702.htm,Radioiodine therapy,"Description The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of your lower neck. It produces hormones that help your body regulate your metabolism . Your thyroid needs iodine to function properly. That iodine comes from the food you eat. No other organs use or absorb much iodine from your blood. Excess iodine in your body is excreted in the urine. Radioiodine is used for treatment of several thyroid conditions. It is given by specialist doctors in nuclear medicine. Depending on the dose of the radioiodine, you may not have to stay in the hospital for this procedure, but go home the same day. For higher doses, you need to stay in a special room in the hospital and have your urine monitored for the radioactive iodine being excreted. You will swallow radioiodine in the form of capsules (pills) or a liquid. Your thyroid will absorb most of the radioactive iodine. The nuclear medicine team may do scans during your treatment to check where the iodine has been absorbed. The radiation will kill cells in the thyroid gland and, if the treatment is for thyroid cancer, any thyroid cancer cells that might have traveled and settled in other organs. Most other cells do not take up iodine, so the treatment is very safe. Very high doses can sometimes decrease the production of saliva (spit) or injure the colon or bone marrow.",description thyroid gland gland located front lower neck produces hormones help body regulate metabolism thyroid needs iodine function properly iodine comes food eat organs use absorb much iodine blood excess iodine body excreted urine radioiodine used treatment several thyroid conditions given specialist doctors nuclear medicine depending dose radioiodine may stay hospital procedure go home day higher doses need stay special room hospital urine monitored radioactive iodine excreted swallow radioiodine form capsules pills liquid thyroid absorb radioactive iodine nuclear medicine team may scans treatment check iodine absorbed radiation kill cells thyroid gland treatment thyroid cancer thyroid cancer cells might traveled settled organs cells take iodine treatment safe high doses sometimes decrease production saliva spit injure colon bone marrow,description thyroid gland gland located front lower neck produce hormone help body regulate metabolism thyroid need iodine function properly iodine come food eat organ use absorb much iodine blood excess iodine body excreted urine radioiodine used treatment several thyroid condition given specialist doctor nuclear medicine depending dose radioiodine may stay hospital procedure go home day higher dos need stay special room hospital urine monitored radioactive iodine excreted swallow radioiodine form capsule pill liquid thyroid absorb radioactive iodine nuclear medicine team may scan treatment check iodine absorbed radiation kill cell thyroid gland treatment thyroid cancer thyroid cancer cell might traveled settled organ cell take iodine treatment safe high dos sometimes decrease production saliva spit injure colon bone marrow
